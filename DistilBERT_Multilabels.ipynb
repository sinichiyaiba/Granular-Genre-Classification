his next patient. the door to his consult room slams open, the door handle crashing into the wall probably making some kind of dent and then something large and very hairy comes barrelling through, tongue lolling happily. \\\"hello tuna,\\\" hinata says mildly, as the humongous german shepherd storms in, followed by a series of muffled curses. the lead hooked to tuna's collar twangs as the dog strains against it, and then a person is staggering into the room, pulled along by their massive dog's sheer strength. tuna spots hinata and makes a beeline for him, and the person attached to the other end of his lead emits a high pitched cry before they stumble and fall to the floor in a heap. \\\"hello atsumu,\\\" hinata says calmly, reaching with one hand for his coffee cup and petting tuna who is now sitting in front of him quite politely with the other. \\\"'ello shouyou,\\\" atsumu mumbles into the consult room floor. \\\"have you gotten into trouble again?\\\" hinata asks, directing his question down at tuna, as atsumu continues to lie prone on the floor. tuna pants happily at him, before trying to stick his nose into his pockets. \\\"i don't keep biscuits in there,\\\" hinata scolds, gently pushing at tuna's enormous head until the dopey dog moves away. \\\"ya shouldn't give him anythin', he doesn't deserve it.\\\" hinata raises an amused eyebrow as atsumu clambers ungracefully back to his feet and shoots a dirty look at his disobedient dog. well. disobedient for atsumu, anyway. whenever osamu accompanied him down to the office tuna was always beautifully behaved. the same went for atsumu's boyfriend. he just seemed to be deaf to any commands issued by his actual owner. \\\"what happened?\\\" hinata prompts, when no immediate problem is presented for him to solve. \\\"went runnin' off where he shouldn't have been in the woods again he's got some sorta cut on his shoulder. i dunno what from. i just saw the blood and called. it's always somethin'.\\\" hinata hums thoughtfully and settles his coffee cup back down on the side by his computer, turning his attention tuna. \\\"sit,\\\" he commands softly, smiling as tuna dutifully lowers his haunches, and starts rifling around in his thick fur where atsumu is pointing. tuna, ever since he was small, has had a very bad habit of finding any and all sharp objects that could possibly exist on his walks and bodily crashing into them. hinata's lost count of the amount of stitches he's placed into him over the years. from paws to ears, anywhere that it's possible to get a cut, tuna has achieved it. it's not that atsumu is neglectful it's just tuna is incredibly clumsy. \\\"oh, found it,\\\" hinata murmurs as he finally parts tuna's coat in the right place, revealing a shallow wound in the meat of his shoulder. \\\"it's quite superficial.\\\" \\\"does it need stitches?\\\" atsumu sighs, resting one hand on the examination table and rubbing his temple with the other. \\\"not\\u2026 necessarily.\\\" hinata tilts his head this way and that, considering. he could get away with staples the edges are neat, there's no damage to the deeper tissues\\u2026 a clip and a clean, it should heal up fine. but tuna is a very active, very boisterous dog who isn't likely to sit still and rest for the next week or so that the staples would need to stay in. \\\"stitches would be more secure,\\\" he finally says over his shoulder, \\\"unless you've got some way of keeping him calm? i can put staples in\\u2026\\\" \\\"have ya met him? he's an idiot,\\\" atsumu grumps, rounding the examination table to ruffle his dog's ears, a bit of fondness seeping in through his annoyance. tuna wiggles in place, completely oblivious to the problems he's causing. \\\"what about if he stays with osamu?\\\" hinata suggests, rising up from his crouch to busy himself by his work surface gathering what he needs to clean the wound. while atsumu's boyfriend had good control over him hinata has no idea how, atsumu changes the story each time he still lived with atsumu. whereas osamu is by himself, and tuna would, hopefully, be a little more inclined to behave without atsumu around to cause him to forget all self-control. atsumu scowls harder at the mention of his twin. \\\"the favours he'll want from me\\u2026\\\" \\\"what do you hate more? favours or paying out for another stitch-up?\\\" \\\"now, see, ya only say that because you've only seen 'samu when he's bein' nice. he ain't nice to me.\\\" hinata resists the urge to roll his eyes. he's known both the miya twins for many years now he and atsumu lived together for a while during college and he knows full well they're as bad as each other when they want to be. but he'll never forget that one time, when he was barely out of vet school and more than a little terrified, when tuna had eaten a bone and needed surgery to have it removed when it got stuck. how he had been so nervous to be the one tasked with saving his friend's dog, and how it had been osamu that had held atsumu's hand the entire day both literally and figuratively - and kept his brother calm so that hinata could concentrate. atsumu could complain as much as he wants, but osamu has never truly let him down. \\\"speaking of- how's your little\\u2026 arrangement goin'?\\\" hinata grunts his confusion at the question, not looking up from where he's beginning work on clipping away the fur surrounding tuna's wound. by the time he's got it all cleaned up atsumu should've come to a decision on what he wants him to do. it'll probably be the staples option, he's just working his way up to actually admitting it. atsumu waves vaguely at the coffee cup by hinata's computer. \\\"the free coffees. 'samu told me about your uhh\\u2026 benefactor.\\\" \\\"oh!\\\" hinata glances up at atsumu as he reaches for his cleaning materials in a little bowl. he'll have to ask atsumu to turn around in a moment though, because he needs to attach a needle to end of a saline bag to flush the wound properly and atsumu is terribly needle-phobic. (atsumu denies this vehemently. hinata dutifully says nothing while his friend does breathing exercises in the corner whenever tuna needs an injection.) \\\"yeah it's really nice of them!\\\" hinata says, louder to be heard over the buzzing of his clippers as he trims away the fur around the wound. \\\"i was a little hesitant at first but osamu talked me into it. said the person who offered was really genuine about it.\\\" \\\"he just wants the business,\\\" atsumu mutters, before saying louder: \\\"ya don't find it weird a client's buyin' you infinite coffees?\\\" hinata doesn't answer this at first. instead he wipes away the loose fur, and gets to work with his cleaning. tuna sits perfectly still, fixated on the small jar of treats hinata keeps by his computer - oblivious to what's going on by his shoulder. the thing is\\u2026 hinata has a hunch as to where the coffees are coming from. or who they're coming from, he should say. the timing from when he'd had that incredibly busy day and had had nothing to eat until late afternoon to suddenly being offered all the coffee and food he wants the morning after\\u2026 it couldn't be coincidence. and yet it still seems so fanciful he doesn't want to dwell on it too much, just in case his hunch is completely wrong. \\\"shouyou.\\\" atsumu looms over his shoulder to get his attention, frowning hard. \\\"i mean, not really\\u2026 they want to, right?\\\" hinata offers, focusing on his work to avoid the judgemental stare aimed his way. \\\"remember that time ya got bitten by that parrot - of all things - and wouldn't accept the lift to the hospital from its owner even though you were bleedin' all over the place?\\\" \\\"mmmm\\u2026\\\" hinata hums, feeling a frown of his own starting to build across his forehead. he reaches for his needle and saline bag, pulling the cap off with his teeth and making a show of sticking it into the bag. atsumu straightens abruptly and takes vivid interest in a poster about dental health on the wall. \\\"so that i,\\\" he continues, louder, \\\"had to take ya myself , two hours after the damn bird bit ya, because you wouldn't take the lift? 'didn't want to take advantage' i think your words were.\\\" \\\"i didn't!\\\" hinata insists, indignant, almost spraying tuna's entire leg with saline as he whips his head around to glare at atsumu. his friend still has his back turned to him though irritatingly so he huffs and refocuses his attention. \\\"it wasn't her fault her parrot did that! she didn't have to\\u2026\\\" \\\"and this guy doesn't have to buy ya coffee,\\\" atsumu points out, turning back around and making a show of leaning against the examination table. \\\"'samu said he was your type\\u2026 lemme guess, you think he's cute, right?\\\" hinata grips his saline bag so hard he drenches his knees, a puddle forming on the floor. tuna pants happily and rises from his sitting position to bend his head and lick the salty liquid from the floor, tail wagging madly. \\\"i don't think he's cute!\\\" hinata squawks, steadying tuna with one hand on his collar so the dog doesn't wander too far away. then clears his voice and flicks his eyes to the door to his consult room, acutely aware he might be overheard. \\\"i don't,\\\" he hisses, when atsumu just raises an eyebrow at him. \\\"but ya know who i'm talkin' about, don't ya?\\\" hinata twists the now empty saline bag between his hands, his knuckles going white as he mauls the plastic. a furious blush burns his cheeks for a second, before he sighs loudly in defeat and throws his used materials into the various bins around his room with a flourish. atsumu did always manage to draw out the dramatics in him. \\\"yes, okay? yes,\\\" hinata groans when atsumu rises up from the table and saunters over to him, looking unbearably smug. because that really is the confirmation isn't it? he doubts osamu would've whipped out a photo for his brother, but if he was able to describe him well enough that atsumu has an idea of what he looks like then it must be\\u2026 \\\"yes to ya know who i mean or yes that he's cute?\\\" atsumu needles. hinata does glare at him this time, the daggers landing as he stalks to his treat jar and determinedly feeds tuna two biscuits. it's alright. they're low fat and tuna is massive. he's not a hypocrite. \\\"i'm getting my stapler,\\\" he snaps, stomping from the room. atsumu's voice floats after him, switching from sly to whiny in an instant. \\\"what! i didn't agree to owin' 'samu a favour!\\\" hinata ignores him as he storms down the hall to fetch what he needs. not five minutes later, he's placed a neat, short row of staples, fast and efficient. tuna, in hinata's professional opinion, seems to be utterly immune to pain. it's not the first time he's thought this, considering the amount of times he's patched him back together again, but it never ceases to amaze him how completely unfussed by everything the shepherd is. the staples went in easily tuna didn't even blink at their insertion and hinata sits back to assess his handiwork. one of his neatest jobs, he thinks tuna certainly injures himself enough to provide a good amount of practice. \\\"so i need him back in-\\\" \\\"-ten days, yeah i know,\\\" atsumu grumbles, still grouchy that he has to ask his brother for a favour. \\\"and call osamu when you leave,\\\" hinata adds, with a layer of sternness to his voice. atsumu grabs for tuna's lead, ruffles his ears and murmurs some quiet words of praise, before he falls silent, his face stormy and brow creased. hinata tilts his head at the sight, feeling worry start to build. atsumu could sometimes throw a tantrum about giving his brother any sort of advantage, but the truth is the two did rely on each other a lot. normally, atusmu's protestations are merely surface level whinging, and nothing more. \\\"it can't be any worse than when he got you to mop the coffee shop floors for a week-\\\" hinata starts to say, trying to lighten the mood that his friend has found himself in, when atsumu suddenly interrupts him. \\\"are ya eatin' properly now?\\\" hinata blinks, thrown. \\\"i always eat properly,\\\" he says slowly, because he does. his diet's exceptional. \\u2026 when he has time to eat, that is. \\\"\\u2026 oh,\\\" he says, just as slowly, as realisation dawns. atsumu ticks an eyebrow up at him, silently urging him to continue. \\\"i\\u2026 yeah, i guess,\\\" hinata mumbles, running a hand through his hair in his sudden fluster. it is certainly much easier to call the shop and get lunch arranged osamu has many healthy and delicious options, it's never hard to pick than it is to find time to prepare meals. plus with the current\\u2026 arrangement, there's always sustenance nearby, if he needs it. \\\"you should just ask him out on a date already. i'll do it for ya, if you're chicken.\\\" hinata bristles immediately. \\\"he's a client!\\\" he hisses, just remembering to temper his volume in time. \\\"i can't ask my clients out on dates!\\\" \\\"ya think he's cute and judgin' by how he buys ya coffee and lunch every day he's probably pretty sweet on you too. can't see this blowin' up in your face if i'm honest, shouyou,\\\" atsumu says, his voice an odd mix of falsely mild and genuinely sincere. he does this sometimes. \\\"when was the last time ya saw someone, anyway?\\\" \\\"okay, time to go, i have other patients to see,\\\" hinata shoots back, this time letting his voice climb up loud. just the thought of his dating history or complete lack of, these days is enough to make humiliation curl hot in his belly. yet alone discussing it in the middle of his working day. he makes flapping motions with his hands at atsumu, urging him towards the door. \\\"can't stand around chatting to you all day. call osamu and then come back and see me for those staples to come out, okay? bye bye.\\\" \\\"call the guy,\\\" atsumu insists, still undeterred even when he's being forcibly shoved from the room. hinata kicks open the door, pauses to rub both hands behind tuna's huge, soft ears, coos at him for being such a good boy, and then directs the shepherd's attention to the flock of crows dancing around in the parking lot, their cries audible even through the waiting room's windows. tuna's tail starts wagging frantically immediately and he launches, barrelling towards the windows instantly. atsumu lets out an undignified shriek as tuna's lead is pulled tight and he's dragged bodily over the threshold. \\\"tuna! shouyou!\\\" \\\"bye atsumu!\\\" hinata sings cheerfully, waving as tuna hurtles towards the windows, atsumu in tow. it's fine. the waiting room's not long enough for tuna to do any real damage. \\\"shouyou!\\\" atsumu hollers back, trying to look stern, but fails miserably as tuna shoots towards another window, whining in his impatience to get to the birds. hinata snickers as atsumu trips over one of the waiting room chairs in a vain attempt to control his overly excitable dog, and once again face plants onto the floor. the room's only other occupant an elderly man with a matching elderly cat blinks vaguely as atsumu sprawls across the ground. defeated, atsumu lets go of tuna's lead, letting his dog burn out his energy staring at the birds, and seems to give himself a moment to just lie prone on the floor, before he eventually clambers to his feet. yachi gives him a bemused look from the reception desk as he saunters towards her, trying to look nonchalant as he brushes off his clothes. \\\"call him!\\\" atsumu shouts over his shoulder, ignoring tuna's whimpering and scrabble of paws against the window panes. hinata resists the urge to roll his eyes and moves to gather up the older gentleman's cat carrier, offering an arm to aid the man in standing. \\\"he calls me!\\\" he shouts back, once his new client is upright and shuffling towards his consult room. he just catches a glimpse of atsumu's bewildered expression as he slips back into his room, and snickers as he hears his name being called indignantly as he closes the door behind him. \\\"it's nice to have friends like that,\\\" the old man says mildly, a small smile on his face as hinata gently places the cat carrier on his examination table. \\\"hmm\\u2026 sometimes,\\\" hinata replies, eyes twinkling. \\\"now, tell me what's wrong with whiskers\\u2026\\\" an hour or so later, hinata is just typing up the last of his notes on his computer, wondering which lab result is the most prudent for him to look into first, when the now empty coffee cup by his computer catches his eye. pausing in his writing, hinata taps his fingertips idly against his keyboard, unable to stop the smile that stretches its way across his face. hinata really can't do anything on his end he has a professional stance to maintain but well, if he was asked instead\\u2026 he would certainly give it some consideration. \\\"hinata?\\\" hinata blinks and swivels on his stool to face yachi, standing in the doorway. \\\"kageyama's on the line for you.\\\" \\\"ahh, right on time,\\\" hinata grins, and grabs the empty coffee cup to toss it into the bin from his seat. he reaches for the phone in his room and takes the call, holding the receiver between his shoulder and ear so that his hands are free to bring up carrot's notes. it won't be the question he's hoping for the queries about the new problem kageyama has run into this week but hinata has long since given up denying these phone calls from the grumpy, somehow adorably awkward musician, all add up to be one of the highlights of his week. \\\"kageyama,\\\" he says once the line connects, \\\"what do you need to ask me today?\\\"\",\n          \" after knowing charles for so many months, erik is sure he knows everything there is to know about him. erik knows charles is smart. he knows charles is kind. he knows that charles is a remarkably powerful mutant, that he enjoys tea, that he plays rugby, that he sometimes laughs in his sleep. he knows that charles' ribs are ticklish, that there is a small birthmark on the top of charles' right buttock in the shape of a tiny heart, that charles' toes cramp when he comes. erik knows charles loves him. but what erik doesn't know is where charles goes every wednesday afternoon. at first erik doesn't even realise that charles' absence on those days is telling. it has taken such a long time for the two of them to reach a place where they are in an actual committed relationship, and previously their encounters were so unregimented and sporadic that erik never really noticed that none of those meetings took place on a wednesday between 1pm and 3pm. but then, erik realises. erik is in the library with charles that day, writing up some notes from the lecture he had in the morning. at the university charles and erik both attend there are no classes on wednesday afternoons, meaning most students spend their free time studying or relaxing or drinking. it is a beautiful sunny day and erik is considering going for a walk with charles, or perhaps driving him to the secluded hillside spot that has become their special place, or maybe taking charles back to his dorm room so he can spend some time in bed with charles laid out beneath him. but before erik can get out the words to vocalise any of the options charles is standing up from the table, shoving his books into his bag, and announcing his plans to leave. \\\"you're going?\\\" erik asks, shooting charles a curious glance. \\\"mm? oh, yes- sorry, darling, i have somewhere i need to be\\\". \\\"you had somewhere you needed to be last wednesday\\u2026\\\" erik replies, thinking of the previous week when he'd invited charles to join himself and the brotherhood on an outing to the cinema before charles had declined the offer. there is an immediate pang of jealous in erik's chest, splintering into his heart with echoes of \\\"it's happening, you knew this couldn't last, he's found someone better, you don't deserve him\\u2026\\\" for some time erik has known that charles is not his equal, that charles is brighter, smarter, kinder than erik could ever hope to be- that his words and actions make him worthy that he deserves more than erik can provide. in that moment part of erik wants to say nothing else, wants to allow charles to leave and simply go home alone to dwell in silence and solitude. but charles has made erik promise long ago that erik would not hide, and though it is difficult, though erik wants to protect himself from everything that could expose his vulnerabilities, he is trying to be better- for charles. \\\"are you keeping something from me\\u2026?\\\" erik asks, getting out that much but leaving off the end of the sentence that says: \\\"if you are i don't really want to know, because if you leave me you'll destroy me\\\". charles pauses, looking at erik as he tucks an unruly lock of hair behind his ear. charles' hair is too long again- a chaotic brown mop atop his head- but erik likes it. he likes the way charles' hair falls against his chest when charles falls asleep in his arms, and the way charles' hair brushes against the inside of his thighs when charles kisses him there. \\\"not keeping something from you, no\\u2026\\\" charles replies cautiously. \\\"where i go is not a secret, i just haven't mentioned it because i wasn't aware you wanted to know\\\". \\\"why wouldn't i want to know?\\\" \\\"no reason\\u2026 erik, look- although i may think about you all the time i don't always take care to plot your reactions to certain things, or to assume what you do or don't want. please don't interpret my failure to disclose this particular piece of information as some sort of attempt to deceive you. i would never lie to you, darling, or keep anything from you. but this is the first time you've asked me where i'm going so it didn't seem necessary to mention it until now\\\". \\\"alright\\u2026\\\" erik says eventually, feeling the tight knot of dread in his chest begin to dissipate at charles' reassuring words. \\\"so, where are you going?\\\" charles smiles at that, picking up the last of his books in one arm and extending the other hand towards erik, before waggling his fingers in invitation. \\\"come and see\\\". half an hour later erik is sat next to charles in a train that carries them across the city. normally erik doesn't particularly enjoy public transport, preferring the convenience of his car above all else, but there is something comforting about being enclosed by metal all around feeling the wheels of the train glide easily along the tracks as it takes them to their destination. next to erik, charles is scribbling notes into a notepad- words and numbers and symbols spilling out across the page like extracts of charles' mind expressed in untidy black ink. erik will never cease to be amazed at the speed of charles' brain, at the ease of his thoughts, at the way he can make connections with a single step that others cannot reach in a giant leap. he is brilliant. what's even more remarkable is the fact that he is erik's. as erik watches charles he leans over, slides one arm into the space between charles' back and the upholstered seat of the train, and slips his thumb under charles' shirt to gently draw circles against the skin of charles' spine. charles murmurs in response, pausing his work to turn and look at erik, and smiling affectionately. using his telepathy charles presses a soft kiss against erik's mind, and the warmth of the gesture remains evident all the way through the rest of the journey. sometime later erik is standing next to charles as they both look up at a large building. in the warm air there is the sound of police sirens nearby and the low rumble of music playing punctuated by the occasional enthusiastic shout. across the street from where they stand the neighbouring block of flats has numerous broken windows and there is a car up on blocks in front of the building, and erik suddenly understands why charles would not let him drive. of all the places erik might have imagined charles might be spending his wednesday afternoons, erik never pictured this. simply from the way charles speaks it is clear he has an air of class about him, and from what charles has disclosed about his childhood erik knows he originally came from money, even if he is no longer as wealthy as he once was. knowing that information, erik can't help but be surprised that charles has been evidently spending his free time in a clearly disadvantaged neighbourhood, the only question is why. then erik sees the sign that displays the building's means of business, and he understands. for the rest of the afternoon erik is in a classroom, watching as charles stands at the front of the room surrounded by eager children who hang on his every word. from the second erik enters he knows why charles has chosen this particular space to spend his time. all around erik are signs that these children are different, special- evident in blue skin and red eyes and incredible wings and horns and scales. even the children who seem 'ordinary' soon shown themselves to be anything but, after charles' gentle encouragement of course. some are shy at first, but charles sits with them and talks softly and listens to their responses, and slowly, gradually they reveal their mutations. erik is fascinated, but unsurprised, and he knows helping others is what charles is made for. no one pays charles to attend the school, to dedicate one afternoon a week to assisting with the education of this small class of mutants, but erik knows that it would never be about that for charles anyway. charles lives to help others, to assist disadvantaged individuals in particular, and the benefit gained through the smiling faces of the tiny mutants all around him is clearly reward enough. of course, not all the tiny mutants are interested in charles exclusively\\u2026 at first erik is content to stand quietly at one side of the room and watch the scene in front of him, feeling his heart clench at the sight of charles, wide-eyed and smiling, encouraging a young boy to levitate a nearby stack of books. charles' enthusiasm is infectious and he is never more beautiful than when he is embroiled in one of his areas of interest, and erik is simply lost for a while as he stares over at charles in wonder. but then there is a hand on erik's knee, tugging at his trouser leg, and erik drops his gaze to regard a small girl with large, brown eyes, who holds up a cookie to erik like a gift. when charles comes to erik later he is sat on the floor with the girl, watching in fascination as in front of him swirls of blue and purple light refract in the air. they are bursts of energy, capable of tearing down buildings or destroying lives, but here they are a toy, a game, and erik is comforted to realise that there may be a future for these children where they can use their powers freely without fear of reprisal, and not be seen as weapons by default. perhaps charles will be the one to make it so. perhaps erik will help him. erik is so engrossed he barely notices as charles approaches, not until there is a gentle hand carding through erik's hair, and erik looks up to find charles staring down at him with pure, unadulterated love and affection on his face. charles pushes erik's hair back from his forehead, smiles at him, and says softly: \\\"thank you for coming with me\\\". erik doesn't need the gratitude- this afternoon has been a gift not a chore- so he simply smiles back at charles and tells him: \\\"you're welcome, mein geliebter \\\". the journey back to the university is frustrating and overly long. there are train delays and overcrowding, and the situation is made worse by the stifling heat that arises in the late afternoon and envelopes the city in a dense smog. but erik doesn't mind. charles is happy, almost giddy, and when charles experiences such moods he usually expresses himself by being even more tactile than usual- something that erik has grown to adore. and so, charles stands next to erik as they wait for a train, hugging one of erik's arms close to his chest as he rests his head against erik's shoulder. erik leans back against the wall behind himself and coolly surveys the scene, and knows that people are watching, and finds curiously that he doesn't mind. charles is a treasure, something to be proud of, and if his behaviour displays to the world that he is erik's then erik is okay with it. there are a couple of times when charles leans heavily on erik, like he is close to falling, and erik can tell from the way charles' eyelids are lowering that he is tired. but as erik looks down at where charles head rests on his shoulder and asks: \\\"are you alright, schatz ?\\\" charles simply tilts his face up at erik, his eyes a deep blue like a night sky full of pure white stars, and replies: \\\"i've never been better\\\". when they eventually manage to get a train erik secures a seat for himself and charles, wraps his arm around charles and pulls him close, allows charles to snuggle into his chest, and is completely unsurprised when charles falls asleep in less than a minute. the nap on the train seems to restore charles' energy levels somewhat, and though when they reach the university erik has to gently shake charles awake, by the time they are walking together across campus charles is buoyant and lively once more. he chatters happily about the mutants they just met, about the progress they are making, about how cute erik looked playing with the children- something erik glowers at even if his derision is somewhat forced. of course, when charles is in such a jubilant mood even erik's pretend scowling cannot dispel his enthusiasm, so charles only smiles wider and playfully pokes at erik's sides. erik tries to grasp charles' arms but charles only squirms free and pokes erik even more, and then they are both laughing despite erik's best attempts, until erik finally grasps charles' wrists and pulls him close so they are pressed against each other. charles gazes up at erik, the brilliant blue sky of that day reflected in his eyes, and erik is so, so close to kissing him before suddenly charles flashes erik a wicked grin and pulls out of his hold, and then he is clutching his bag close to himself and running across campus whilst shouting: \\\"first one back gets the first blowjob!\\\" there are a group of students walking nearby and part of erik is embarrassed to think that they might have heard charles' outburst, but a bigger part of him is entertained by charles' levity, and keen to win the challenge\\u2026 and so, erik races after charles, and it isn't long before he has him. erik catches up to charles somewhere near the student lounge, and passes him so easily that it's almost laughable. erik suspects that perhaps charles is hampered by the sheer weight of the books in his bag whilst erik isn't quite as burdened, or perhaps it's the thought of charles on his knees with his cherry-red lips around erik's cock that prompts erik to race ahead. either way, erik reaches the dormitory perhaps twenty seconds before charles does and waits at the entrance, arms folded across his chest triumphantly as he waits for charles to catch up. when charles arrives his cheeks are tinged with colour and his hair is in even more disarray than usual, but his smile is almost as wide as erik's which suggests that charles isn't too put out about losing. \\\"nice of you to join me\\\", erik calls light-heartedly as charles sidles up to him and gives erik the finger. in consolation erik takes charles' bag from him and hauls it over his shoulder, and slides his hand into charles' to hold it as they walk upstairs. when they enter erik's room the space is warm and humid thanks to both the weather that afternoon and the fact that the heat has risen from the floors below, but with a flick of erik's fingers a nearby electric fan is turned on and erik is stepping over to the window to open it up. he's barely finished pushing open the window though when he feels charles step up behind himself- charles' arms snaking around erik's waist and charles' face pressing against erik's back. \\\" hallo \\\", erik chuckles, laying his hands against charles' arms and stroking his palms along the fine hairs on charles' forearms. \\\"everything okay?\\\" \\\"mm\\u2026\\\" charles replies, rubbing his face between erik's shoulder blades. \\\"i'm just really happy you came to the school with me\\\". erik smiles. \\\"i am too. those children are remarkable- it's amazing that you're helping them like that\\\". \\\"you helped too, erik. i think they really liked having you there. well, i know they did. i did too\\u2026\\\" with that, charles squeezes erik more tightly, rising up on his tiptoes to press his face into the back of erik's neck and whispering: \\\"i love you\\\". the words are said into erik's skin like charles is trying to imprint them there, like he is trying to mark erik with the sentiment- a clear impression of how charles feels etched into erik's skin like a tattoo. it's more than erik needs in terms of clarity- he already feels charles' devotion in every breath charles' takes- but being reminded of it on an almost daily basis is a gift nonetheless. \\\" du bedeutest mir alles\\u2026 \\\" erik says softly, using the lessons charles has taught him to press his affection into charles' mind like a kiss, one that charles clearly recognises as immediately he lets out a happy murmur- his breath warm against erik's neck as he begins to place kisses to erik's skin. \\\"you're getting really good\\u2026\\\" charles responds, his mouth trailing along the taut line of erik's shoulder. \\\"plus, i really like feeling you inside me like that. it's kind of kinky\\u2026\\\" \\\"is that so\\u2026\\\" erik smirks, turning around to face charles and cupping charles' face in his hands. \\\"well, don't think that gets you out of me being inside you in the other way - we did have a deal, after all\\\". \\\"ah, i suppose we did\\u2026\\\" charles grins, his eyes wide and mischievous. \\\"well, i'm a man of my word if nothing else\\u2026\\\" he adds, licking his lips and just starting to drop to his knees, before erik grips charles under the arms to stop him. \\\"clothes off first\\u2026\\\" erik requests firmly, trying to look authoritative and unaffected rather than like someone completely besotted with lust. charles quirks an eyebrow in response but heeds erik's words, beginning to slowly unbutton his shirt as he stares into erik's eyes. of course, charles can't just perform the act without being a fucking tease about it, and he undoes his buttons slowly, torturously, flashing erik glimpses of creamy white skin adorned with a constellation of freckles as he gradually shrugs the garment off. when his chest is bared charles next turns his attention to his trousers, but doesn't just remove them quickly either. he draws his fingertips slowly over his belt buckle first, knowing that erik can feel the warmth of charles' hands against the metal, and smirking as erik lets out a barely-suppressed groan in response. \\\"something wrong, dear?\\\" charles asks, his sweet face the epitome of faux innocence as he draws his belt slowly through the clasp of the buckle before removing it completely. erik practically wants to growl in frustration, and drag charles over to the bed to hurry things along, but erik has learned that- when it comes to charles- the wait is always undeniably worth it, even if it means erik suffers from a low burn of arousal that makes his cock strain uncomfortably against the confines of his trousers. besides, within a moment the wait is over, and charles is letting his clothing fall to the floor to stand before erik with his hands clasped together in front of himself- dropping his gaze and appearing almost nervous, almost shy. it's remarkable to erik that, after so many encounters, after all the things charles has let erik do to him, he still has the capacity to be somewhat bashful- as if erik hasn't seen every inch of charles' skin before now, or mapped it out with his tongue. charles isn't even fully nude, but the sight is completely captivating nonetheless- particularly as erik can see the prominent line of charles' erection just visible behind his clasped hands, pushing up against the loose material of his boxer shorts. charles' underwear is new- erik can tell, he has seen every aspect of charles' wardrobe enough to recognise any changes, and besides- erik would know if he has seen this particular garment before\\u2026 erik laughs softly, reaching down to grasp both of charles' hands and gently tugging them apart. \\\"well, these are certainly interesting\\u2026\\\" erik grins, hooking one finger into the front of charles' boxer shorts and running it along the hem, drawing it over the sensitive skin above charles' groin and causing charles to inhale a shaky breath in response. the boxer shorts charles is wearing are grey, and are adorned with a pattern of tiny red magnets and yellow lines presumably supposed to represent a magnetic pull. erik has become accustomed to the eccentricities of charles' wardrobe, which appears to be a mix of decidedly formal shirts, trousers, and cardigans, along with a number of t-shirts emblazoned with scientific slogans and several pairs of gaudy patterned socks, but until this point charles' underwear has always remained entirely neutral in colour and style. erik can only hazard a guess as to why charles has made any changes now. \\\"these are for me?\\\" erik asks, stepping closer and using his grip on the underwear to pull charles towards himself. \\\"everything i do is for you\\\", charles replies with complete conviction, staring down and watching erik's hand as it touches him. \\\"do you like them?\\\" \\\"yes\\u2026\\\" erik says with a smile, drawing his thumb across the point of charles' hip, where the red starburst of a fading bruise on charles' skin marks out the evidence of erik's earlier affections. \\\" liebling \\u2026 you're beautiful\\u2026\\\" at that charles looks up, and the experience is like being hit by a thunderbolt. the sunlight glinting through the open window is reflected in charles' eyes, in the dazzling array of blue in his irises- like leagues of colour in the ocean, like water that can sustain life or drown people in its wake. charles smiles at erik seemingly in gratitude, almost like he is surprised at the words, and erik can understand why\\u2026 although erik may regard charles with such affection and devotion it sometimes makes it hard for him to breathe, he has never been very good at expressing himself. words of sentiment, when seldom spoken, are often concealed in erik's native language- reminding him of the last time he was able to speak so freely, when he did so to his mother. there is a wall around erik's heart, and though charles' careful influence has rendered the barrier as increasingly more like a trellis, the gaps in erik's defences can only let so much through. often erik wonders if it is enough, and if his own conservation will drive charles away in the end, but when charles looks at erik like this- with such love and pure faith in his eyes- erik can allow himself to hope for a time that everything will be okay. the moment passes without further comment, more said between their eyes and from their hearts than what can be expressed in words, and then charles is smiling somewhat impishly as he trails his hands down erik's forearms, using his grip on erik's hands to encourage erik to push the underwear down. charles' boxer shorts drop to the floor, and erik barely has time to look before charles is kicking the underwear away and kneeling down on the soft carpet at erik's feet. charles keeps his eyes locked with erik's as he settles down, knees parted, hands resting against the floor, cock hard and standing to attention between his legs. it's a completely bewitching sight, and the desire for erik to hastily wrench free of his clothing has never been more tangible. but this is no longer about what erik can take from charles it's about what he can give to him, and so erik mimics charles' slow seduction from before, and removes his clothing leisurely. on the floor, charles is patient. he watches erik devotedly, like there is no finer sight in the world than erik gradually peeling his t-shirt off and throwing it across the room, like there are untold secrets hidden in erik's trousers and he cannot wait to discover them. erik is having a moment of regret as he unbuttons his jeans, wishing he had taken the time to kiss charles before he settled down, that he had pressed his tongue into charles' eager mouth to taste charles' moans before pushing him to his knees, but it is too late for that now. and besides, when erik slides his trousers and underwear down in one smooth motion, the look on charles' face makes up for it. charles stares at the parts of erik now exposed and his hands immediately tremble like he aches to touch, but whatever desire charles is experiencing is kept in check as he once more looks back up to meet erik's eyes, waiting patiently. \\\"no hands\\\", erik says quietly, edging his discarded clothing away with his feet before stepping closer, feeling the plush carpet tickle the space between his toes. charles' eyebrows raise in response, but there is a tell-tale smile in the corner of his mouth that says he likes this game, as he always does, and so he simply shifts a bit closer, and waits. erik cannot fight the urge to touch, so he slides one hand into charles' hair to hold him, to connect with him, and then he moves closer and angles his cock towards charles' waiting mouth. their eye-contact is unbroken as charles parts his lips, as erik feels charles' breath ghost across the head of his cock, as erik begins to push inside, feeling charles' mouth- warm and accommodating- start to surround him. erik uses his hold on charles' hair to guide him, watching transfixed as charles' perfect pink lips slide along the length of his shaft, groaning quietly as charles' clever tongue swirls around the head of his cock. erik can't help but buck his hips at that, and though it's hard to tell completely, erik is sure he can see the flicker of a smile in charles' bright eyes. after a short while erik lets go of his hold on charles' hair and stops rocking forward, watching instead as charles sucks gently on the head of his cock for a while before pushing forward to take the full length in his mouth again, always looking up at erik, always keeping his hands resting against the floor as instructed. erik can only tolerate a few moments of that before he has to touch charles again- stroking one hand through the soft locks of charles' hair as he leans forward to glance down at the smooth line of charles' back, at pale skin interspersed with an array of freckles leading down to the round curve of charles' buttocks. as erik admires the view charles pushes further, causing erik to groan as he feels his cock slip into the tight channel at the back of charles' throat, until charles gasps around the length and has to withdraw, and removes his mouth completely. when erik leans back to look at charles again his face is flushed and he is breathing hard, but he still looks at erik with such love it makes erik's heart ache with feeling in response. erik brushes charles' hair back from his forehead and yearns to kiss him, but charles is once again edging forward to take erik's cock in his mouth before erik can do anything, leaving erik lost to the feelings of pleasure once more as his member slides into wet heat. still, as erik gazes down at charles he smiles at him, murmurs: \\\"you're amazing\\u2026\\\", and there is a sensation erik can feel coming from charles' mind like a surge of warmth, and erik knows he is happy. as the encounter continues it is very much like a balancing act a reciprocal give-and-take that varies between erik fucking charles' mouth and charles sucking erik's cock, each action causing a hot, tight sensation to build up in the base of erik's member, causing his stomach muscles to flutter promisingly with each lingering thrust. the sensation is heightened by the moans coming from charles that erik feels vibrate through the length of his shaft, moans that are either as a result of charles feeling erik's pleasure rolling off of him in heady magenta waves, or simply because charles is just enjoying himself that much. when erik draws close he once more slides a hand into charles' hair, entwining his fingers in thick brown tendrils whilst using his other hand to grasp hold of his own cock, and starting to stroke. it doesn't take much- charles' mouth is still sucking gently at the head of erik's cock and making erik groan in response- and with charles continuing to look up at erik so devotedly erik feels the pleasure drawn from himself like charles is commanding it, like charles needs it as much as erik does. as erik's breath stutters in his throat charles finally moves his hands, resting one palm on erik's knee and squeezing lightly as erik comes into charles' mouth, watching as erik groans in his pleasure and his speech is lost to intermittent german curses. there is some time after erik has finished coming when charles still keeps his mouth on erik's cock, drawing his lips slowly along the shaft as erik's fingers fumble blindly in charles' hair in his hazy pleasure-state, until erik finally pulls back to let his cock slip out of charles' mouth and charles once more withdraws his hands. for a while erik continues to gaze down at charles, stroking his fingers slowly through charles' hair, thinking about how much he loves and needs this man who will drop to his knees without question, who will give erik everything he wants but can never ask for. it goes much further than the intimacy they've shared, than all the times charles has given his body to erik in wilful subjugation. as charles has already said, everything he does is for erik, and though part of erik cannot understand why charles is able to be so devoted to someone so unworthy, he is grateful for it nonetheless. charles remains sat on the floor looking up at erik, warm sunlight from the window casting a glow upon his face, illuminating every delicate freckle on his skin like fading embers in a fireplace. he is beautiful, and erik reaches down for him without question, slides his hands under charles' arms to pull him up, grasps charles' thighs once charles is upright and hauls the smaller man up- causing charles to let out a slight noise of surprise in response before he adjusts and wraps his legs firmly around erik's waist to hold on. erik carries charles over to the bed and lays down upon it, finding the sheets to be warm against his back courtesy of the rectangle of light that illuminates the bed complimented by the heat from charles' body against his front. it takes a bit of wriggling before erik is able to recline comfortably against the pillows, and then he lays there- still and sated- as charles hums happily and nuzzles his face into erik's neck, his hair brushing against erik's chin as he settles down. there is a low buzz of noise coming from the world outside- faint voices, a pulse of music playing, birds singing. erik registers none of it. his world is inside this room, in his bed, in his arms. nothing else matters. erik trails his fingertips slowly down the curve of charles' spine, smiling as charles lets out a tiny moan and snuggles nearer to erik, like close isn't close enough. erik can feel charles' cock, warm and hard in the tight space in-between their bodies, but charles makes no move to chase his own bliss. it's a marker of the selflessness charles exhibits during every encounter he shares with erik, like he is simply content to be with erik in whatever guise erik chooses, and he expects nothing in return. \\\"you're perfect\\u2026\\\" erik murmurs, pressing his knuckles into the dimples above charles' ass. against the side of erik's neck charles lets out a small chuckle. \\\"you're only saying that because you've just had your cock in my mouth\\\", he replies. \\\"no, charles- i'm saying it because you're extraordinary\\\", erik counters, tilting his face towards charles and sliding one hand into his hair. charles turns his head at that, bathing erik in a bewitching bolt of blue as he gazes into erik's eyes. \\\"darling\\u2026\\\" charles says softly, one hand tracing circles on erik's chest with his fingertips. \\\"thank you. you're perfect too\\\". erik can't help but scoff in response, and though he immediately sees a flicker of discontent manifest in charles' expression he cannot bring himself to regret his reaction, not even when charles frowns and lifts his head from erik's shoulder, looking down at erik disapprovingly. \\\"i wouldn't say it if i didn't mean it, erik. you're perfect to me\\\". there are wealth of reasons erik could offer up for why charles is wrong- all the parts erik can feel within himself like stains on his soul- but erik suspects charles already knows, even if he is too polite to ever mention it out loud. it's likely charles doesn't regard those aspects as imperfections anyway- he has a habit of seeing the good in everything, in everyone. it's one of the things erik loves about him most of all. \\\"you're perfect\\u2026\\\" charles whispers, leaning close to place heartfelt kisses to erik's jawline, cheek, forehead- drawing soft lips across erik's skin as his hands move to cup erik's face. erik can feel charles' mind too, like soft light in his periphery, like the sunlight coming in through the open window, warming every part of erik that is cold and dark. erik is close to admitting defeat as he lies there holding charles' waist, but he still huffs quietly under his breath and says: \\\"you can't say that- you haven't just had your cock in my mouth\\\". of course, charles laughs, his breath warm against erik's temple where charles' mouth is currently pressed. \\\"oh, so is that the requirement for uttering that statement after all?\\\" charles smirks. \\\"well, if you'd like to rectify the situation i'm only too happy to accommodate you\\u2026\\\" he adds, wriggling his hips so that erik feels charles' hard member press more firmly against his stomach. it's as good a way of keeping charles quiet as any, and so erik murmurs: \\\"alright\\\", and slides his hands down to cup charles' arse to encourage charles to sit up. charles does so, slowly, but once he is seated straddling erik's waist he looks down at erik and says: \\\"sweetheart, i was joking \\\". \\\"i wasn't\\\", erik replies, squeezing charles' buttocks lightly. \\\"come here\\u2026\\\" erik pulls charles gently but firmly towards himself, even as charles continues to ask erik if he is sure, until charles is kneeling just in front of erik's face and he grasps the windowsill behind the bed to steady himself. transferring his grip to hold charles' waist, erik pulls charles closer, but bypasses charles' straining erection and presses his mouth instead to the soft skin of charles' groin, causing charles to groan heatedly in response. charles' helpless moans continue for a while as erik trails his tongue over to the crease of charles' thigh, grazes his teeth gently over the point of charles' hip, until finally he withdraws and brings his mouth close to charles' cock at last, and brushes his lips against the sensitive head before opening up and taking charles in. as erik slides his mouth along charles' cock he looks up, seeing that charles' eyes are closed but knowing that his senses are wide open anyway. erik can feel the swell of charles' pleasure through more than just the thick length in his mouth, he can feel it coming from charles' mind like a warm summer breeze gliding through erik's perception continual waves of pleasure cresting across erik's mind as erik sucks earnestly on charles' cock. other than the occasional impassioned moan, charles is still and serene, and the only movement he makes is to reach down with one hand to gently push erik's hair back from his forehead. he looks down at erik and he is glorious- pale and lovely in the sunlight of the afternoon, like he is carved from fine marble, like he is a work of art. when charles comes he does so with a low murmur- his release something erik feels run through every part of himself like a pulse of electricity thanks to the power of charles' telepathy. charles' legs tremble as he shudders through his orgasm so erik uses his hands to hold charles steady, and keeps his mouth moving on charles' cock until charles shifts uncomfortably due to the increased sensitivity, and erik allows him to withdraw. charles moves like he is going to drop to the side to lay next to erik, but instead erik keeps hold of charles and pulls charles back down on top of himself once more, wrapping his arms around charles' back firmly and tilting his head to place a kiss to charles' forehead. there are a few blissful moments when charles lifts his face and kisses erik slowly, passionately, like there is nothing he would rather be doing with his afternoon, with his life, and then he settles down once more with his head resting against erik's chest. \\\"you're perfect\\u2026\\\" charles murmurs quietly. for once, erik doesn't argue with him.\",\n          \" kel 25 had a sky the color of charcoal and dirt a few shades darker connie could only tell sky from earth by tracing the high black mounds in the distance, which stood out against the horizon like silhouettes of hulking giants. against the pitch were gleaming white towers, hints of other colors shining like opals in muck. connie looked for the three nested towers of what pearl called the temple of heaven and earth and started walking. the robonoids followed her. her mission was simple: retrieve the poofed and damaged gems that had been trapped in the collapsed towers if she could, scout the area if she couldn't, and determine what had caused every gem in the area to suddenly lose contact with homeworld three hundred years ago. connie knew that steven would have preferred to come with her, and that she would have been smarter to wait, but she really hadn't wanted to. it was only a little mission, and there were no documented predators or even multicellular organisms on this planet. if she was injured or got sick, one of the robonoids would sent out a distress message. there wasn't any real danger. plus, she thought as her communicator activated in her ear with a little ding, it wasn't like she was out of range. \\\"... connie? how are you doing so far? is there any sign of hostilities?\\\" \\\"nothing yet, pearl,\\\" connie said, climbing up a few boulders and sliding down the other side with a thump. her boots threw up little puffs of dirt. \\\"just a whole lot of atmosphere. this place is really fascinating!\\\" it was. gems had surveyed it three centuries ago and had found a wealth of minerals below the surface. they had touched down in their aesthetically-designed ships in all their multitudes, had built temples and towers and had started terraforming- and then it had stopped all at once, every preliminary colonist cutting off contact without warning, and since no one important had been lost, the diamonds had written them off. now, since gems were supposed to have individual worth as sapient beings, the diamonds were finally sending out a search party. three centuries late. maybe that wasn't too long for gems- connie remembered no tv for one thousand years , thank you very much- but it was still discouraging. \\\"i suppose it is,\\\" came pearl's reluctant response, \\\"but you can never be too careful. remember, this is a scouting mission. if you encounter any dangerous situations, you are not to engage.\\\" \\\"understood, ma'am.\\\" connie walked for another hour, digging out a protein bar for quick calories and ducking into shadowed alcoves at any sign of a glint. she found a smashed piece of what looked like a communicator, an intact gem destabilizer, and something that could have been a gem shard but turned out to be a rock. eventually she passed under hulking abandoned injectors, thick bacteriophage drilled into the ground with empty tanks, but there were no holes around them where new gems had been born kel 25, for one reason or another, hadn't birthed any of the new diopsides or jades that it had been annexed to provide. the injectors cast deep shadows over the black soil as the distant twin suns dropped under the horizon, one lagging behind the other like a nervous child. connie checked her rations, figured they were acceptable, and called the robonoids closer so one of them could provide some light. the rest of them continued to range out around her, scanning the ground for shards. the red light didn't damage her night vision, which was why it was so useful it did bathe the alien landscape the color of warm blood, only illuminating the ground a few feet around her before the light faded into red-tinged shadows. connie kept her eyes on the ground, careful not to step in any holes or trip over an unfortunate rock. she'd already tripped once, scraping her elbow, and she wasn't interested in doing it again. only another hour to the temple. she would have transported there directly, but the closest working warp pad had been out in the wastes, and pearl had thought there might be gems who had fled to it before the colony's collapse. kel 25 had an incredibly dense core for its size, which gave it about the gravity of mars, but its days lasted about three hours each. connie had never had a chance of completing the whole expedition in daylight. she wouldn't have had a chance to go on the expedition at all, except that there was a breathable atmosphere and something had already happened to the gems in residence. the hope had been that an organic could scout out the location without being detected immediately as a gem might. connie had mostly jumped on the chance because she'd been stir-crazy it was spring break back home, and she hadn't been to space in ages . the temple came into view, opaline towers gleaming dully in the beams of the robonoids, and immediately one of them froze like a pointing dog, laser fixed on a shining spot on the ground. connie hurried over and plucked the gem up in her hands, then jerked back in disgust and dropped it. \\\"sorry,\\\" she said awkwardly, even though the gem probably couldn't hear her. she shook the black goop off her palms, grimacing at the sticky thickness of it, and scraped the rest off on a convenient rock, into the earth then, pulling on gloves, she picked up the gem again and scratched the rest of the gunk off. it was a peridot, completely undamaged but covered in dust. she'd never reformed. that didn't bode well. \\\"pearl?\\\" connie asked, knowing the comm would activate at her name, \\\"i found my first gem. she's a peridot, and i don't see any damage, but her gem was covered in this weird black goo. i think it might be keeping her from coming back.\\\" she waited for a response, but none was forthcoming. \\\"pearl? are you there?\\\" connie felt goosebumps rise on her arms. \\\"spread out,\\\" she said, and the robonoids fanned out around her, illuminating the area. nothing moving but them, no changes close to them but her communicator wasn't working anymore. connie pulled off one of her gloves and reached up to tug it out of her ear, frowned when she noticed the speck of black on its shimmery casing. she hadn't touched it before just then, so where...? she touched the black speck, and it stuck to her finger easily enough, but the comm remained dull. and here she'd thought pearl had only been distracted for a while. stupid . how long had she been out of contact? more importantly, what was this black stuff? she stuffed the peridot's gem in her bag, deciding not to use any more gem tech if she could help it, and came to a decision, feeling remarkably clear-headed. the goop wasn't hurting her, and as long as she didn't get it on the warp pad it should still work, shouldn't it? but every moment these gems spent down here could mean they were deactivated permanently, if they weren't already, and nothing had actually harmed her yet. plus, the more she brought back to the ships, the more chance homeworld's scientists would be able to reverse whatever had happened to these gems. she just had to do her job and scout, like she was supposed to. the temple's entrance was crumbled in on itself, the bridge that led to the rest of it cut off halfway and almost definitely unstable. connie spied a higher level, half-open to the air, and shot her grappling hook to catch in one of the grooves. she tugged- it held- and buckled herself into her climbing harness, making her careful way up the crumbling mosaic of blue diamond. the robonoids followed her closely, but kept to her orders not to touch the walls. she didn't want to risk losing them, too. the second floor yielded more gems, stuck to the floor or walls, alone or in clusters of two or three. connie pried them loose carefully, keeping track- ruby, ruby, lapis lazuli, some kind of quartz- as she placed them in her bag. one of them she tried to pull loose and pulled in half instead, the black goop the only thing keeping it together connie swallowed at that, distant sorrow hitting her like a wave, and packed the two halves carefully, just in case. there weren't any other signs of struggle in the hallways- no scuffs on the walls, no holes in the floor, no broken weapons or shattered pieces. only lights that wouldn't come on, and doors that had to be pried open with a crowbar, and that black dust collecting thick and tarry on every surface. connie dug out her own head lamp, deciding on certainty over retained night vision, and lit her way forward as brightly as she could. it didn't help her unease as much as she'd hoped it would. \\\"i don't know if you can hear me, pearl, because i definitely can't hear you,\\\" connie said, voice barely a whisper in the empty rooms. it still echoed like a gunshot, deeper into the earth. \\\"but you shouldn't send any gems down here. something is seriously wrong.\\\" farther in. she started to find hints of life, signs that gems had existed here once: a few scraps of someone's pet tech project, gem script scratched into a wall in what looked a lot like graffiti, a chamber full of weapons strewn about like someone had interrupted a sparring match. there was an observation orb lying dead on the ground in one chamber, and a whole line of buttons and screens coated black in another. some parts had script that didn't seem like gem, too, or bits of technology that weren't familiar at all, but connie ignored those she had a mission to complete. she found a sapphire, two other blue gems she couldn't identify, and something she thought was a kind of rutile. her bag grew full, but she kept finding them, so she kept stuffing them in, wincing when they clinked against each other. there were three hundred gems here, at least. she'd never been meant to actually collect this many. she was a scout. going into the earth. she climbed up to the third floor of the temple, forcing open the entrance to the first tower, and had squeezed entirely through before she realized that the only light she had was white. \\\"robonoids?\\\" no response. she peered back through the slim entrance she'd managed to create, but no red floating orbs were in sight. they must have touched the walls at some point. she breached the next inner sanctum, gazing wide-eyed at the delicate inlays of the ceiling, iridescent white and blue like mermaid's scales there was only one gem in this room- a pearl- and connie had to scrabble with her fingers for twenty minutes to pry it loose. in the inside of the tower, ceiling so high above it was like looking at the sky, she could see more clearly how the blackness had spread: it only ebbed into color at over twenty feet in the air, watermarking the walls like flood gauges. connie stared at it, transfixed, then reached up to her comm- except it wasn't in her ear. not on the floor, either, and not outside in the hallway. \\\"pearl?\\\" she asked aloud, confused, but the comm didn't spark to life. because... it had been disabled, like the robonoids. disabled, and yet she'd kept going deeper into the temple without even marking her way, with only one light and no food and no way out and this hadn't even been her mission - why was she here? she should have turned back as soon as her comm stopped working. she should have reported that something was wrong, taken the first gem she'd found back with her and come back with reinforcements, let homeworld's scientists look over the samples she'd taken so far. she shouldn't have gone deeper in, alone, without giving her friends any way to track her or know what she was doing. something was incredibly wrong. something was... affecting her, maybe, making her think in ways she'd been trained out of. for what purpose? what reason - a glint in the corner of the room. connie moved toward it by rote, but it wasn't a gem it was a little doll with a shard of rock sewn into its chest, with too many arms and a face that wasn't human, wasn't really humanoid at all. connie held it blankly, unable to make her mind work, before something in her screamed pay attention! and she realized that her hand looked wrong. her veins were black . she swallowed back panic and rolled up her sleeve to see the black streaks cutting through her skin all the way up to her elbow, which was stained pitch like she'd dipped it in ink the dark stripes continued to her shoulder and radiated onto her collarbone, the back of her neck, above her breasts. she pressed on the dark parts, but didn't feel pain whatever it was doing to her, discomfort was not a part of it. connie took a deep breath, forced herself to sit down and cross her legs. no more movement until she knew what was going on. that was final . an alien doll. a black gunk that killed gem tech as soon as it touched it. an infection that made her move deeper into the temple and forget what she was supposed to be doing. what did those have in common? what did they mean? unfamiliar script and technology meant... someone else had been there? for long enough that they would have made toys with gem shards and marked up the walls. they had been there, but they weren't there now. possibly the same thing had happened to them as had happened to the homeworld terraformers- as was happening to connie. she needed to get back to the warp pad. connie got to her feet, stuffing the doll in her bag for safekeeping, and stepped back out of the exit. her mind blanked when she stared down both sides of the hallway, but she gritted her teeth and chose a direction, scratching a long line across the wall with the remnants of a gem destabilizer. the temple wasn't that big. she could get out, and if she couldn't she could last a few more hours and follow sunlight to an exit. whatever was happening, it wasn't going to get her. urgency forced her out of the tower, towards the outer parts of the temple, but the hallways all blurred together. had she gone left or right, at that junction? had she been at that junction at all? more discrepancies jumped out at her: rotted food beneath the black mold, sketched-out drawings of creatures she'd never seen before, a knife with unfamiliar stylings at the hilt. she kept picking them up to put in her bag before realizing that they weren't gems and didn't need to be taken with her. it took her longer to notice that the reason she couldn't put anything in her bag was because she'd dropped it, somewhere between the inner sanctum and the first tower, and when she did notice it sent a cold trickle of fear down her back. so. she couldn't trust her own perceptions at all, then. what could she do? she took the gem destabilizer- she still had that, at least- and scraped out a message on the walls, as legible as she could make it: don't touch. it changes your mind. did that make sens e? did that make any sense at all? would it matter if aliens saw it, since they might not translate? maybe all those inscriptions she'd seen hadn't been graffiti but similar warnings, made useless by language barriers. connie wished she wasn't too hyped on adrenaline and nerves to be fascinated by what could be an alien rosetta stone. she finished the message and stepped back, turning to the exit- except she didn't know where the exit was. she didn't- but there was an exit. but she had a mission? no, the mission was to- to scout , to get out, to go deeper into the temple and into the earth . \\\"i'm not doing that,\\\" connie said to no one, but she found herself following a path anyway, stepping past discarded gems and organic scraps. connie trailed the gem destabilizer across the wall whenever she thought of it, but mostly she followed the path. her feet were made for the path, or must have been, because it had been followed before. she could see prints in the black beneath her boots. her hand caught at one of the doorways, gripping white-knuckled, and she took advantage of the momentary confusion to wrench herself back and sink to the floor, bury her head in her knees. stay still , she told herself. stay still. when you get lost you have to stay still until someone finds you, you (deeper into the earth) have to wait for rescue. \\\"something's in my head, ma'am,\\\" she said aloud, because she thought she should. \\\"i'm compromised. can you find me?\\\" somehow she was standing again, and then she was moving. her feet hurt, but her pace didn't slow. the headlamp flickered off, finally running out of battery. she didn't know if that meant it was daylight. it didn't matter. she had a path. (into the earth) she had a path and she would follow it, if her feet would stop stumbling, if her hands would stop catching at things, if her knees would stop crumbling when they didn't even hurt. again she was kneeling, scratching something into the black gunk: st st st st over and over again, not even a full word. stop? stay? stretch? \\\"steven,\\\" she tried, but it didn't make sense why she'd be writing his name anywhere. he wasn't coming with her into the earth. he was- in space, in orbit, at home. on the other planet. not this planet but a different, vaster one, a stranger one with lighter soils. the walls lost their gem-patterns and became dark and musty, close to her shoulders so she had to turn sideways to get through the passages. there must have been light coming from somewhere she could make out shapes in the dark, and she didn't trip even once. the sides of the tunnels expanded and contracted under her fingers when she pressed against them. they were warmer than her hands. into the earth for hours and hours, until her stomach felt tight, until her feet cracked and bled, until her ankles blistered against her socks and her legs ached, following the path laid out for her. somewhere she dropped the gem destabilizer, too, but she didn't mind it was less weight to carry. finally the walls were more red than black, bathed crimson by a warm, beckoning light connie stepped out into an open chamber, a cavern so wide that its ceiling was like a stalactite-laden sky, and stared in wondering horror. once, connie had seen the crystal heart that powered the temple back in beach city, bright pink and glassy this heart was a deeper red, so vast it stretched from one horizon of the cavern to another, broader than all of beach city combined. gleaming bitter red, glowing with blood-warmth and pulsing, humming through her flesh until she felt loose like wet meat, flushed all in black and blood. others were there, too, strange beings with too many arms and carapaces, creeping along the walls or skittering on the floor. connie couldn't move, could only stare with blown-wide pupils at the massive beating heart, the lovely sanguine center of the planet, could only absorb the sight of it. her thoughts ebbed and flowed, jumbling into each other until some inner levy broke and sloshed them loose then she crumbled to her knees, suddenly light-headed, and said, \\\"wait. i don't- this isn't my planet.\\\" it was, though, came the thought. it was her planet. her tunnels, her beating heart to serve. it thrummed through her like her own pulse, drove her blood to warm her. connie shuddered, hugging herself, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it was right, that it had- \\\"those gems,\\\" she tried again, but the thought had already left her. determination made her press on, made her gather them back to her like scraps of paper. she would say what she meant to say. \\\"those gems, you- hurt them. you're the planet. you hurt these people.\\\" some of the aliens came closer to her, catching her by the arms and pulling her back into a side of the cavern, into an alcove in the wall, into the earth. they herded her into the dirt and she kicked, bit at them, lizard-brain terror catching where coherence couldn't reach. but there were so many of them. so many, blank and empty-eyed, rotten black and sloughing skin into the dirt to feed the earth. they pushed her in and moved close, pulling strands from their bodies and wrapping her, binding her as the heart pulsed through her mind and made her limp and unresisting. they cocooned her away from the light. connie's hands were trapped against her chest, fingers brushing the heavy strands as they smothered her she pushed against them just a little, curious, but couldn't press past that. into the earth. into the planet. this wasn't something she should fight. the heart beat through her in a lazy percussion, expanding and contracting scarlet on the insides of her eyelids when she blinked. she closed her eyes without meaning to and breathed slowly, in and out like she was meditating, until her mind drifted away. the heartbeat drove her blood to warm her. * silence. * connie opened her eyes with a gasp, wriggling in her bonds, and immediately tried to scream. her body didn't respond to her commands, though, only moved like it had a mind of its own, and fear suffused her like cold water. she'd- been stupid, cut herself and not noticed , gotten mind-controlled and now it was too late - the cocoon was dark and suffocating, red light bleeding through the fibers and making her skin glow dark, making the streaks in her veins stand out. the heartbeat pounded through her skull, disturbing now instead of comforting she tried to block it out, humming in her mind, but it bashed through her thoughts like they didn't exist, made her brain feel like it was welling up with blood. all crimson, behind her eyes, all saying go to sleep, leave it be, sink into the earth but she couldn't, she wouldn't, if she did she would cease to exist . she threw every part of her will at her body, lashing out for control of one eyelid, one finger, one muscle fiber. it was as useless as fighting an ocean. before, when the heart had been leading her, she'd been able to subvert it now it was like it had taken her brain and left her severed from every nerve ending, a vestigial organ just waiting to be culled. like being a puppet. but she couldn't be, she didn't want to die, she had so much to do still- connie tried to scream again, tried to cry, tried to thrash and escape but her body wasn't hers anymore, was just moving on its own like an automaton - \\\"hold on,\\\" her voice rasped, sounding surprised, and she froze. that tone of voice- was that-? \\\"am i connie?\\\" relief surged through her, and she collapsed back into the background, desperately grateful. not the heart. not a mindless puppet for an alien planet, not a meatsuit for breaking gems and killing shipwrecked aliens. her body was in safe hands. in steven's hands. her best friend didn't seem to know what to do with himself at first he used her fingers to press against the skin of the cocoon, blinking slowly, then forced through the fibers with her shoulder. the push made him stumble painfully into the ground, and he righted himself immediately, staring at her black-streaked hands. they were shaking . \\\"what's going on?\\\" i'm being mind-controlled by the planet, connie tried to say, but steven only turned to look around the cramped tunnel, obviously confused. he couldn't hear her, connie realized with a start. he couldn't hear her at all . but then how would he know where to go, where to pick up the injured gems? steven! steven, i'm right here, you have to listen to me! nothing. connie despaired as he stared at her surroundings, feeling her eyes go wide with horror. \\\"have you been trapped here all this time? connie, i'm so sorry, i- i should have come sooner-\\\" he cut off, tears pricking at her eyes, but connie's mind was blank. what? how long has it been? steven? her body continued to move without her permission, steven wincing at her bloodied feet and staggering with one hand to the wall. the tunnel they'd herded her into was so tight that it scraped against both her shoulders, constricting her chest when she inched sideways, and connie was ninety percent sure that it had deepened after they'd cocooned her in. she felt steven shudder at the claustrophobic fit. crimson light glowed at the entrance to the larger chamber, filling the doorway with red like a giant eye steven faltered, shrinking back, but squared her shoulders. he knew as well as connie did that there wasn't another way out. he stepped into the beating heart's chamber and froze up completely, pulse going rapid. connie winced back from the thrum of influence that pulsed through her, marshaling her thoughts together as her only defense steven, still taking in the chamber, saw the carapace-aliens and shrank back into the tunnel. \\\"that's not good,\\\" he whispered. \\\"were they kidnapped, too?\\\" if you'd actually hear me i could help you, connie couldn't help thinking, nervous and snappy with it, but of course it didn't reach him. steven hid in the tunnel until one of the aliens stepped into it and stopped at the sight of him, then said tentatively, \\\"hi. i'm steven. can you, uh- can you understand me?\\\" the alien regarded him blankly, head lolling and eyes rotten black out of its head, thorax falling apart like an ant possessed by fungi. black sludge dripped off it and plopped onto the floor one of its many arms hung limp and snapped-off at its side. too far gone for thought, connie figured, and felt steven mirror the conclusion. his arm rose up defensively in front of him as the alien approached, then faltered when no shield appeared. she could feel the realization steal over him: no powers, no familiarity with the body, only whatever connie had left in her after being held captive for what had apparently been more than a day. steven, you have to listen to me! you don't know the way out! \\\"can you hear me?\\\" he pressed anyway. \\\"are you still alive in there?\\\" he reached out- steven, what- and touched the zombie alien's side, making a face at the sludge coating connie's hand. the alien paused, body stiffening- connie felt a burst of incredulity- then flew into motion, grabbing connie's wrist and slamming her against the wall. steven yelped in her voice and kicked out at it, wriggling loose and ducking beneath its claws, but her body was weak. other aliens wrestled it onto its knees. they held her arms behind her back and forced them- forced steven - to look into the beating heart. it was blood and warmth and vitality so intense it hurt to witness was glowing brighter than a star, washing the world crimson like a moonset, feeding its life into the dirt and the rock and its trillions of spores. its arteries reached into the core of the planet, its capillaries fine and fast beneath its crust, its lungs molten in the mantle of the world. in the high chamber it was the world, so large it reminded connie of steven's description of the cluster, and its veins reached over connie's head like massive tree trunks sunk deep into the earth. deeper into the earth. she was- this was her planet, she belonged to it- she felt her fists clench. \\\"you can't have her,\\\" steven growled with her voice. \\\"she doesn't belong to you. none of these people do!\\\" something thrummed, pulsed, throbbed through her flesh and pulled it apart like cooked muscle, loose and stringy connie felt nauseous and transfixed, overwhelmed, but steven only said heatedly, \\\"she doesn't belong to anyone.\\\" the hive-aliens crept closer, stained with black goop and dripping it. \\\"i need you to let her go, okay? i know it must have hurt when homeworld started drilling into you, but connie didn't have anything to do with that. she's just here on a rescue mission.\\\" it doesn't care, connie tried to say, but the words wouldn't come. steven, what are you doing? the heart reached into her head and twisted, dragging a scream out of her that never left her lips. connie lashed out at it, trying to make her thoughts a sword, but it batted her aside like she was nothing, smothered her thoughts until she couldn't breathe. \\\"what are you- stop that!\\\" steven sounded panicked. could he feel it, could he feel her? could he hear her? the heart pulsed brighter in retaliation for his command, searing out every thought in connie's head even as she spat and cursed at it, threw all she had into resisting, but it wasn't enough and the agony was blinding, steven steven please- \\\"i said stop it!\\\" steven screamed in connie's voice, and the red light snapped back and dimmed like it had been struck. connie felt strange, like there was something overlapping with her body, something new coursing through her like fresh energy- and then the sensation disappeared, feet moving rapidly beneath her, and she realized that steven was running. running the wrong way. connie tried to lurch her feet in the right direction, jerk a hand, anything, but her body wasn't her own: steven had taken it over completely. she settled for yelling at him, trying to get him to hear something, but she was too late. her body ran up to a dead end, panting and shaking, and she felt her face fall. steven whirled around, but the aliens were already blocking the exit, clustered against the light. we can still fight! she yelled, but he was already shrinking back, hesitance making him slow. he could heal anything. if he could just get her body to the surface he could resurrect her, anything would be better than being an eternal mind-slave to a sociopathic planet, seriously , steven! one of the aliens jerked closer on rickety legs, and steven dove under it, rolling onto his feet and dashing down another hallway. he bounced off the breathing walls in his haste, shuddering at their warmth, and took passages wildly, darting back and forth like he was under a spell. connie didn't understand until steven muttered, \\\"come on, garnet,\\\" doubling back and narrowly dodging more of the hive-aliens, and then she realized it was future vision. she hadn't known he could carry that over into another body. her feet were bleeding worse now, but there was no time to stop steven sprinted into gem-made tunnels at last, taking turns like he'd lived in the temple all his life, and tripped over her bag, slamming hard into the ground. he scrambled upright immediately, tense like he was about to keep running, but stopped and stared at the bag for a second before grabbing it and slinging it over her shoulder. connie sighed in internal relief. finally her body wouldn't move any farther, muscles shaky and unable to hold her weight, and steven wedged her into a small alcove at the temple's edge and hid, ears straining for any sign of pursuit. it took a while for connie to push past her exhaustion to notice he was speaking. no- he was crying, tears streaming down her cheeks and leaving trails in black dust. \\\"please don't be too late,\\\" he was whispering, hugging her knees. \\\"i'm sorry i didn't notice, i'm sorry, please don't be too late, you'll be okay, i know you will-\\\" and connie hadn't thought about how it must seem, that he'd taken over her body when he must have only wanted to contact her, but now it was all too obvious. i'm fine, i'm right here, we're almost out, she tried to push at him, but he didn't hear her. he just kept weeping, quiet and terrified, completely unaware of her presence. \\\"i'm gonna get you out of here,\\\" he promised, \\\"we have a plan, okay, we just need to get to the cliff and we can get out, take all these gems with us, you just have to be alive in there, okay? don't be a zombie. it's hard to be jam buds with a zombie.\\\" believe me, steven, i'm trying my best. eventually she heard scuffling below them steven heard it too, scrambling to her feet just as a horde of aliens erupted from the dirt, and then they were running even as connie felt like she was about to collapse. the aliens were fast, wherever they'd been from. they moved like spiders or scorpions, skittering in quick tiny steps, and connie's exhausted body wasn't quick enough to outrun them. in her mind the heart pulsed come back come back come back, but she didn't have to listen, didn't even have to resist listening her body wasn't in either of their control. the aliens chased them to the west of the temple, away from the warp pad and to the jagged hills connie was only starting to remember the maps she'd reviewed when steven crested a hill and she realized they were heading straight toward a cliff. was this what you were talking about? steven? her friend froze, staggering like he saw something else, then- stumbled, faltered- connie leaped to her feet, adrenaline coursing through her veins, and whirled to see a horde of aliens encroaching. her brain felt empty and strange, echoey, and she couldn't find any trace of steven anywhere. \\\"steven?\\\" she shouted through her rasping throat. \\\"steven, are you there? what am i supposed to do from here? did you see something else?\\\" future vision could have told him this would kill her, or that his body was under attack, or any number of things. what had made him leave so suddenly? what had he seen, what was he planning to do? was the cliff still part of the plan? it didn't matter either way connie was cornered, and she'd never been clued in in the first place. she backed up as the horde approached, snarling and lashing out at reaching appendages, and thought, come on, garnet. thought he was heading toward the cliff, he was running full tilt and stopped suddenly, if i'm caught i'm dead anyway and steven won't let me die- the cliff. the cliff was the plan, and steven hadn't been planning to stop, and anyway she was out of options. if she died, they could retrieve her body and resurrect her if she broke every bone in her body, steven could heal her. the only unacceptable option was being enslaved by the beating heart, and she already knew steven could pull her out if that happened. it was like one of the trust falls that their gym teachers made them do in school: close your eyes, spread your arms, lean back. let gravity take you. if you were lucky- if the other person was strong enough, was paying attention- they would catch you. was steven strong enough? was he paying attention? connie already knew the answer to both was yes . \\\"you should have asked nicely,\\\" she rasped at the encroaching horde, daring to smirk, and stepped backwards into open air.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"genre\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

'ello shouyou, atsumu mumbles into the consult room floor. have you gotten into trouble again? hinata asks, directing his question down at tuna, as atsumu continues to lie prone on the floor. tuna pants happily at him, before trying to stick his nose into his pockets. i don't keep biscuits in there, hinata scolds, gently pushing at tuna's enormous head until the dopey dog moves away. ya shouldn't give him anythin', he doesn't deserve it. hinata raises an amused eyebrow as atsumu clambers ungracefully back to his feet and shoots a dirty look at his disobedient dog. well. disobedient for atsumu, anyway. whenever osamu accompanied him down to the office tuna was always beautifully behaved. the same went for atsumu's boyfriend. he just seemed to be deaf to any commands issued by his actual owner. what happened? hinata prompts, when no immediate problem is presented for him to solve. went runnin' off where he shouldn't have been in the woods again he's got some sorta cut on his shoulder. i dunno what from. i just saw the blood and called. it's always somethin'. hinata hums thoughtfully and settles his coffee cup back down on the side by his computer, turning his attention tuna. sit, he commands softly, smiling as tuna dutifully lowers his haunches, and starts rifling around in his thick fur where atsumu is pointing. tuna, ever since he was small, has had a very bad habit of finding any and all sharp objects that could possibly exist on his walks and bodily crashing into them. hinata's lost count of the amount of stitches he's placed into him over the years. from paws to ears, anywhere that it's possible to get a cut, tuna has achieved it. it's not that atsumu is neglectful it's just tuna is incredibly clumsy. oh, found it, hinata murmurs as he finally parts tuna's coat in the right place, revealing a shallow wound in the meat of his shoulder. it's quite superficial. does it need stitches? atsumu sighs, resting one hand on the examination table and rubbing his temple with the other. not\\u2026 necessarily. hinata tilts his head this way and that, considering. he could get away with staples the edges are neat, there's no damage to the deeper tissues\\u2026 a clip and a clean, it should heal up fine. but tuna is a very active, very boisterous dog who isn't likely to sit still and rest for the next week or so that the staples would need to stay in. stitches would be more secure, he finally says over his shoulder, unless you've got some way of keeping him calm? i can put staples in\\u2026 have ya met him? he's an idiot, atsumu grumps, rounding the examination table to ruffle his dog's ears, a bit of fondness seeping in through his annoyance. tuna wiggles in place, completely oblivious to the problems he's causing. what about if he stays with osamu? hinata suggests, rising up from his crouch to busy himself by his work surface gathering what he needs to clean the wound. while atsumu's boyfriend had good control over him hinata has no idea how, atsumu changes the story each time he still lived with atsumu. whereas osamu is by himself, and tuna would, hopefully, be a little more inclined to behave without atsumu around to cause him to forget all self-control. atsumu scowls harder at the mention of his twin. the favours he'll want from me\\u2026 what do you hate more? favours or paying out for another stitch-up? now, see, ya only say that because you've only seen 'samu when he's bein' nice. he ain't nice to me. hinata resists the urge to roll his eyes. he's known both the miya twins for many years now he and atsumu lived together for a while during college and he knows full well they're as bad as each other when they want to be. but he'll never forget that one time, when he was barely out of vet school and more than a little terrified, when tuna had eaten a bone and needed surgery to have it removed when it got stuck. how he had been so nervous to be the one tasked with saving his friend's dog, and how it had been osamu that had held atsumu's hand the entire day both literally and figuratively - and kept his brother calm so that hinata could concentrate. atsumu could complain as much as he wants, but osamu has never truly let him down. speaking of- how's your little\\u2026 arrangement goin'? hinata grunts his confusion at the question, not looking up from where he's beginning work on clipping away the fur surrounding tuna's wound. by the time he's got it all cleaned up atsumu should've come to a decision on what he wants him to do. it'll probably be the staples option, he's just working his way up to actually admitting it. atsumu waves vaguely at the coffee cup by hinata's computer. the free coffees. 'samu told me about your uhh\\u2026 benefactor. oh! hinata glances up at atsumu as he reaches for his cleaning materials in a little bowl. he'll have to ask atsumu to turn around in a moment though, because he needs to attach a needle to end of a saline bag to flush the wound properly and atsumu is terribly needle-phobic. (atsumu denies this vehemently. hinata dutifully says nothing while his friend does breathing exercises in the corner whenever tuna needs an injection.) yeah it's really nice of them! hinata says, louder to be heard over the buzzing of his clippers as he trims away the fur around the wound. i was a little hesitant at first but osamu talked me into it. said the person who offered was really genuine about it. he just wants the business, atsumu mutters, before saying louder ya don't find it weird a client's buyin' you infinite coffees? hinata doesn't answer this at first. instead he wipes away the loose fur, and gets to work with his cleaning. tuna sits perfectly still, fixated on the small jar of treats hinata keeps by his computer - oblivious to what's going on by his shoulder. the thing is\\u2026 hinata has a hunch as to where the coffees are coming from. or who they're coming from, he should say. the timing from when he'd had that incredibly busy day and had had nothing to eat until late afternoon to suddenly being offered all the coffee and food he wants the morning after\\u2026 it couldn't be coincidence. and yet it still seems so fanciful he doesn't want to dwell on it too much, just in case his hunch is completely wrong. shouyou. atsumu looms over his shoulder to get his attention, frowning hard. i mean, not really\\u2026 they want to, right? hinata offers, focusing on his work to avoid the judgemental stare aimed his way. remember that time ya got bitten by that parrot - of all things - and wouldn't accept the lift to the hospital from its owner even though you were bleedin' all over the place? mmmm\\u2026 hinata hums, feeling a frown of his own starting to build across his forehead. he reaches for his needle and saline bag, pulling the cap off with his teeth and making a show of sticking it into the bag. atsumu straightens abruptly and takes vivid interest in a poster about dental health on the wall. so that i, he continues, louder, had to take ya myself , two hours after the damn bird bit ya, because you wouldn't take the lift? 'didn't want to take advantage' i think your words were. i didn't! hinata insists, indignant, almost spraying tuna's entire leg with saline as he whips his head around to glare at atsumu. his friend still has his back turned to him though irritatingly so he huffs and refocuses his attention. it wasn't her fault her parrot did that! she didn't have to\\u2026 and this guy doesn't have to buy ya coffee, atsumu points out, turning back around and making a show of leaning against the examination table. 'samu said he was your type\\u2026 lemme guess, you think he's cute, right? hinata grips his saline bag so hard he drenches his knees, a puddle forming on the floor. tuna pants happily and rises from his sitting position to bend his head and lick the salty liquid from the floor, tail wagging madly. i don't think he's cute! hinata squawks, steadying tuna with one hand on his collar so the dog doesn't wander too far away. then clears his voice and flicks his eyes to the door to his consult room, acutely aware he might be overheard. i don't, he hisses, when atsumu just raises an eyebrow at him. but ya know who i'm talkin' about, don't ya? hinata twists the now empty saline bag between his hands, his knuckles going white as he mauls the plastic. a furious blush burns his cheeks for a second, before he sighs loudly in defeat and throws his used materials into the various bins around his room with a flourish. atsumu did always manage to draw out the dramatics in him. yes, okay? yes, hinata groans when atsumu rises up from the table and saunters over to him, looking unbearably smug. because that really is the confirmation isn't it? he doubts osamu would've whipped out a photo for his brother, but if he was able to describe him well enough that atsumu has an idea of what he looks like then it must be\\u2026 yes to ya know who i mean or yes that he's cute? atsumu needles. hinata does glare at him this time, the daggers landing as he stalks to his treat jar and determinedly feeds tuna two biscuits. it's alright. they're low fat and tuna is massive. he's not a hypocrite. i'm getting my stapler, he snaps, stomping from the room. atsumu's voice floats after him, switching from sly to whiny in an instant. what! i didn't agree to owin' 'samu a favour! hinata ignores him as he storms down the hall to fetch what he needs. not five minutes later, he's placed a neat, short row of staples, fast and efficient. tuna, in hinata's professional opinion, seems to be utterly immune to pain. it's not the first time he's thought this, considering the amount of times he's patched him back together again, but it never ceases to amaze him how completely unfussed by everything the shepherd is. the staples went in easily tuna didn't even blink at their insertion and hinata sits back to assess his handiwork. one of his neatest jobs, he thinks tuna certainly injures himself enough to provide a good amount of practice. so i need him back in- -ten days, yeah i know, atsumu grumbles, still grouchy that he has to ask his brother for a favour. and call osamu when you leave, hinata adds, with a layer of sternness to his voice. atsumu grabs for tuna's lead, ruffles his ears and murmurs some quiet words of praise, before he falls silent, his face stormy and brow creased. hinata tilts his head at the sight, feeling worry start to build. atsumu could sometimes throw a tantrum about giving his brother any sort of advantage, but the truth is the two did rely on each other a lot. normally, atusmu's protestations are merely surface level whinging, and nothing more. it can't be any worse than when he got you to mop the coffee shop floors for a week- hinata starts to say, trying to lighten the mood that his friend has found himself in, when atsumu suddenly interrupts him. are ya eatin' properly now? hinata blinks, thrown. i always eat properly, he says slowly, because he does. his diet's exceptional. \\u2026 when he has time to eat, that is. \\u2026 oh, he says, just as slowly, as realisation dawns. atsumu ticks an eyebrow up at him, silently urging him to continue. i\\u2026 yeah, i guess, hinata mumbles, running a hand through his hair in his sudden fluster. it is certainly much easier to call the shop and get lunch arranged osamu has many healthy and delicious options, it's never hard to pick than it is to find time to prepare meals. plus with the current\\u2026 arrangement, there's always sustenance nearby, if he needs it. you should just ask him out on a date already. i'll do it for ya, if you're chicken. hinata bristles immediately. he's a client! he hisses, just remembering to temper his volume in time. i can't ask my clients out on dates! ya think he's cute and judgin' by how he buys ya coffee and lunch every day he's probably pretty sweet on you too. can't see this blowin' up in your face if i'm honest, shouyou, atsumu says, his voice an odd mix of falsely mild and genuinely sincere. he does this sometimes. when was the last time ya saw someone, anyway? okay, time to go, i have other patients to see, hinata shoots back, this time letting his voice climb up loud. just the thought of his dating history or complete lack of, these days is enough to make humiliation curl hot in his belly. yet alone discussing it in the middle of his working day. he makes flapping motions with his hands at atsumu, urging him towards the door. can't stand around chatting to you all day. call osamu and then come back and see me for those staples to come out, okay? bye bye. call the guy, atsumu insists, still undeterred even when he's being forcibly shoved from the room. hinata kicks open the door, pauses to rub both hands behind tuna's huge, soft ears, coos at him for being such a good boy, and then directs the shepherd's attention to the flock of crows dancing around in the parking lot, their cries audible even through the waiting room's windows. tuna's tail starts wagging frantically immediately and he launches, barrelling towards the windows instantly. atsumu lets out an undignified shriek as tuna's lead is pulled tight and he's dragged bodily over the threshold. tuna! shouyou! bye atsumu! hinata sings cheerfully, waving as tuna hurtles towards the windows, atsumu in tow. it's fine. the waiting room's not long enough for tuna to do any real damage. shouyou! atsumu hollers back, trying to look stern, but fails miserably as tuna shoots towards another window, whining in his impatience to get to the birds. hinata snickers as atsumu trips over one of the waiting room chairs in a vain attempt to control his overly excitable dog, and once again face plants onto the floor. the room's only other occupant an elderly man with a matching elderly cat blinks vaguely as atsumu sprawls across the ground. defeated, atsumu lets go of tuna's lead, letting his dog burn out his energy staring at the birds, and seems to give himself a moment to just lie prone on the floor, before he eventually clambers to his feet. yachi gives him a bemused look from the reception desk as he saunters towards her, trying to look nonchalant as he brushes off his clothes. call him! atsumu shouts over his shoulder, ignoring tuna's whimpering and scrabble of paws against the window panes. hinata resists the urge to roll his eyes and moves to gather up the older gentleman's cat carrier, offering an arm to aid the man in standing. he calls me! he shouts back, once his new client is upright and shuffling towards his consult room. he just catches a glimpse of atsumu's bewildered expression as he slips back into his room, and snickers as he hears his name being called indignantly as he closes the door behind him. it's nice to have friends like that, the old man says mildly, a small smile on his face as hinata gently places the cat carrier on his examination table. hmm\\u2026 sometimes, hinata replies, eyes twinkling. now, tell me what's wrong with whiskers\\u2026 an hour or so later, hinata is just typing up the last of his notes on his computer, wondering which lab result is the most prudent for him to look into first, when the now empty coffee cup by his computer catches his eye. pausing in his writing, hinata taps his fingertips idly against his keyboard, unable to stop the smile that stretches its way across his face. hinata really can't do anything on his end he has a professional stance to maintain but well, if he was asked instead\\u2026 he would certainly give it some consideration. hinata? hinata blinks and swivels on his stool to face yachi, standing in the doorway. kageyama's on the line for you. ahh, right on time, hinata grins, and grabs the empty coffee cup to toss it into the bin from his seat. he reaches for the phone in his room and takes the call, holding the receiver between his shoulder and ear so that his hands are free to bring up carrot's notes. it won't be the question he's hoping for the queries about the new problem kageyama has run into this week but hinata has long since given up denying these phone calls from the grumpy, somehow adorably awkward musician, all add up to be one of the highlights of his week. kageyama, he says once the line connects, what do you need to ask me today?\",\n          \" after knowing charles for so many months, erik is sure he knows everything there is to know about him. erik knows charles is smart. he knows charles is kind. he knows that charles is a remarkably powerful mutant, that he enjoys tea, that he plays rugby, that he sometimes laughs in his sleep. he knows that charles' ribs are ticklish, that there is a small birthmark on the top of charles' right buttock in the shape of a tiny heart, that charles' toes cramp when he comes. erik knows charles loves him. but what erik doesn't know is where charles goes every wednesday afternoon. at first erik doesn't even realise that charles' absence on those days is telling. it has taken such a long time for the two of them to reach a place where they are in an actual committed relationship, and previously their encounters were so unregimented and sporadic that erik never really noticed that none of those meetings took place on a wednesday between 1pm and 3pm. but then, erik realises. erik is in the library with charles that day, writing up some notes from the lecture he had in the morning. at the university charles and erik both attend there are no classes on wednesday afternoons, meaning most students spend their free time studying or relaxing or drinking. it is a beautiful sunny day and erik is considering going for a walk with charles, or perhaps driving him to the secluded hillside spot that has become their special place, or maybe taking charles back to his dorm room so he can spend some time in bed with charles laid out beneath him. but before erik can get out the words to vocalise any of the options charles is standing up from the table, shoving his books into his bag, and announcing his plans to leave. you're going? erik asks, shooting charles a curious glance. mm? oh, yes- sorry, darling, i have somewhere i need to be. you had somewhere you needed to be last wednesday\\u2026 erik replies, thinking of the previous week when he'd invited charles to join himself and the brotherhood on an outing to the cinema before charles had declined the offer. there is an immediate pang of jealous in erik's chest, splintering into his heart with echoes of it's happening, you knew this couldn't last, he's found someone better, you don't deserve him\\u2026 for some time erik has known that charles is not his equal, that charles is brighter, smarter, kinder than erik could ever hope to be- that his words and actions make him worthy that he deserves more than erik can provide. in that moment part of erik wants to say nothing else, wants to allow charles to leave and simply go home alone to dwell in silence and solitude. but charles has made erik promise long ago that erik would not hide, and though it is difficult, though erik wants to protect himself from everything that could expose his vulnerabilities, he is trying to be better- for charles. are you keeping something from me\\u2026? erik asks, getting out that much but leaving off the end of the sentence that says if you are i don't really want to know, because if you leave me you'll destroy me. charles pauses, looking at erik as he tucks an unruly lock of hair behind his ear. charles' hair is too long again- a chaotic brown mop atop his head- but erik likes it. he likes the way charles' hair falls against his chest when charles falls asleep in his arms, and the way charles' hair brushes against the inside of his thighs when charles kisses him there. not keeping something from you, no\\u2026 charles replies cautiously. where i go is not a secret, i just haven't mentioned it because i wasn't aware you wanted to know. why wouldn't i want to know? no reason\\u2026 erik, look- although i may think about you all the time i don't always take care to plot your reactions to certain things, or to assume what you do or don't want. please don't interpret my failure to disclose this particular piece of information as some sort of attempt to deceive you. i would never lie to you, darling, or keep anything from you. but this is the first time you've asked me where i'm going so it didn't seem necessary to mention it until now. alright\\u2026 erik says eventually, feeling the tight knot of dread in his chest begin to dissipate at charles' reassuring words. so, where are you going? charles smiles at that, picking up the last of his books in one arm and extending the other hand towards erik, before waggling his fingers in invitation. come and see. half an hour later erik is sat next to charles in a train that carries them across the city. normally erik doesn't particularly enjoy public transport, preferring the convenience of his car above all else, but there is something comforting about being enclosed by metal all around feeling the wheels of the train glide easily along the tracks as it takes them to their destination. next to erik, charles is scribbling notes into a notepad- words and numbers and symbols spilling out across the page like extracts of charles' mind expressed in untidy black ink. erik will never cease to be amazed at the speed of charles' brain, at the ease of his thoughts, at the way he can make connections with a single step that others cannot reach in a giant leap. he is brilliant. what's even more remarkable is the fact that he is erik's. as erik watches charles he leans over, slides one arm into the space between charles' back and the upholstered seat of the train, and slips his thumb under charles' shirt to gently draw circles against the skin of charles' spine. charles murmurs in response, pausing his work to turn and look at erik, and smiling affectionately. using his telepathy charles presses a soft kiss against erik's mind, and the warmth of the gesture remains evident all the way through the rest of the journey. sometime later erik is standing next to charles as they both look up at a large building. in the warm air there is the sound of police sirens nearby and the low rumble of music playing punctuated by the occasional enthusiastic shout. across the street from where they stand the neighbouring block of flats has numerous broken windows and there is a car up on blocks in front of the building, and erik suddenly understands why charles would not let him drive. of all the places erik might have imagined charles might be spending his wednesday afternoons, erik never pictured this. simply from the way charles speaks it is clear he has an air of class about him, and from what charles has disclosed about his childhood erik knows he originally came from money, even if he is no longer as wealthy as he once was. knowing that information, erik can't help but be surprised that charles has been evidently spending his free time in a clearly disadvantaged neighbourhood, the only question is why. then erik sees the sign that displays the building's means of business, and he understands. for the rest of the afternoon erik is in a classroom, watching as charles stands at the front of the room surrounded by eager children who hang on his every word. from the second erik enters he knows why charles has chosen this particular space to spend his time. all around erik are signs that these children are different, special- evident in blue skin and red eyes and incredible wings and horns and scales. even the children who seem 'ordinary' soon shown themselves to be anything but, after charles' gentle encouragement of course. some are shy at first, but charles sits with them and talks softly and listens to their responses, and slowly, gradually they reveal their mutations. erik is fascinated, but unsurprised, and he knows helping others is what charles is made for. no one pays charles to attend the school, to dedicate one afternoon a week to assisting with the education of this small class of mutants, but erik knows that it would never be about that for charles anyway. charles lives to help others, to assist disadvantaged individuals in particular, and the benefit gained through the smiling faces of the tiny mutants all around him is clearly reward enough. of course, not all the tiny mutants are interested in charles exclusively\\u2026 at first erik is content to stand quietly at one side of the room and watch the scene in front of him, feeling his heart clench at the sight of charles, wide-eyed and smiling, encouraging a young boy to levitate a nearby stack of books. charles' enthusiasm is infectious and he is never more beautiful than when he is embroiled in one of his areas of interest, and erik is simply lost for a while as he stares over at charles in wonder. but then there is a hand on erik's knee, tugging at his trouser leg, and erik drops his gaze to regard a small girl with large, brown eyes, who holds up a cookie to erik like a gift. when charles comes to erik later he is sat on the floor with the girl, watching in fascination as in front of him swirls of blue and purple light refract in the air. they are bursts of energy, capable of tearing down buildings or destroying lives, but here they are a toy, a game, and erik is comforted to realise that there may be a future for these children where they can use their powers freely without fear of reprisal, and not be seen as weapons by default. perhaps charles will be the one to make it so. perhaps erik will help him. erik is so engrossed he barely notices as charles approaches, not until there is a gentle hand carding through erik's hair, and erik looks up to find charles staring down at him with pure, unadulterated love and affection on his face. charles pushes erik's hair back from his forehead, smiles at him, and says softly thank you for coming with me. erik doesn't need the gratitude- this afternoon has been a gift not a chore- so he simply smiles back at charles and tells him you're welcome, mein geliebter . the journey back to the university is frustrating and overly long. there are train delays and overcrowding, and the situation is made worse by the stifling heat that arises in the late afternoon and envelopes the city in a dense smog. but erik doesn't mind. charles is happy, almost giddy, and when charles experiences such moods he usually expresses himself by being even more tactile than usual- something that erik has grown to adore. and so, charles stands next to erik as they wait for a train, hugging one of erik's arms close to his chest as he rests his head against erik's shoulder. erik leans back against the wall behind himself and coolly surveys the scene, and knows that people are watching, and finds curiously that he doesn't mind. charles is a treasure, something to be proud of, and if his behaviour displays to the world that he is erik's then erik is okay with it. there are a couple of times when charles leans heavily on erik, like he is close to falling, and erik can tell from the way charles' eyelids are lowering that he is tired. but as erik looks down at where charles head rests on his shoulder and asks are you alright, schatz ? charles simply tilts his face up at erik, his eyes a deep blue like a night sky full of pure white stars, and replies i've never been better. when they eventually manage to get a train erik secures a seat for himself and charles, wraps his arm around charles and pulls him close, allows charles to snuggle into his chest, and is completely unsurprised when charles falls asleep in less than a minute. the nap on the train seems to restore charles' energy levels somewhat, and though when they reach the university erik has to gently shake charles awake, by the time they are walking together across campus charles is buoyant and lively once more. he chatters happily about the mutants they just met, about the progress they are making, about how cute erik looked playing with the children- something erik glowers at even if his derision is somewhat forced. of course, when charles is in such a jubilant mood even erik's pretend scowling cannot dispel his enthusiasm, so charles only smiles wider and playfully pokes at erik's sides. erik tries to grasp charles' arms but charles only squirms free and pokes erik even more, and then they are both laughing despite erik's best attempts, until erik finally grasps charles' wrists and pulls him close so they are pressed against each other. charles gazes up at erik, the brilliant blue sky of that day reflected in his eyes, and erik is so, so close to kissing him before suddenly charles flashes erik a wicked grin and pulls out of his hold, and then he is clutching his bag close to himself and running across campus whilst shouting first one back gets the first blowjob! there are a group of students walking nearby and part of erik is embarrassed to think that they might have heard charles' outburst, but a bigger part of him is entertained by charles' levity, and keen to win the challenge\\u2026 and so, erik races after charles, and it isn't long before he has him. erik catches up to charles somewhere near the student lounge, and passes him so easily that it's almost laughable. erik suspects that perhaps charles is hampered by the sheer weight of the books in his bag whilst erik isn't quite as burdened, or perhaps it's the thought of charles on his knees with his cherry-red lips around erik's cock that prompts erik to race ahead. either way, erik reaches the dormitory perhaps twenty seconds before charles does and waits at the entrance, arms folded across his chest triumphantly as he waits for charles to catch up. when charles arrives his cheeks are tinged with colour and his hair is in even more disarray than usual, but his smile is almost as wide as erik's which suggests that charles isn't too put out about losing. nice of you to join me, erik calls light-heartedly as charles sidles up to him and gives erik the finger. in consolation erik takes charles' bag from him and hauls it over his shoulder, and slides his hand into charles' to hold it as they walk upstairs. when they enter erik's room the space is warm and humid thanks to both the weather that afternoon and the fact that the heat has risen from the floors below, but with a flick of erik's fingers a nearby electric fan is turned on and erik is stepping over to the window to open it up. he's barely finished pushing open the window though when he feels charles step up behind himself- charles' arms snaking around erik's waist and charles' face pressing against erik's back. hallo , erik chuckles, laying his hands against charles' arms and stroking his palms along the fine hairs on charles' forearms. everything okay? mm\\u2026 charles replies, rubbing his face between erik's shoulder blades. i'm just really happy you came to the school with me. erik smiles. i am too. those children are remarkable- it's amazing that you're helping them like that. you helped too, erik. i think they really liked having you there. well, i know they did. i did too\\u2026 with that, charles squeezes erik more tightly, rising up on his tiptoes to press his face into the back of erik's neck and whispering i love you. the words are said into erik's skin like charles is trying to imprint them there, like he is trying to mark erik with the sentiment- a clear impression of how charles feels etched into erik's skin like a tattoo. it's more than erik needs in terms of clarity- he already feels charles' devotion in every breath charles' takes- but being reminded of it on an almost daily basis is a gift nonetheless. du bedeutest mir alles\\u2026 erik says softly, using the lessons charles has taught him to press his affection into charles' mind like a kiss, one that charles clearly recognises as immediately he lets out a happy murmur- his breath warm against erik's neck as he begins to place kisses to erik's skin. you're getting really good\\u2026 charles responds, his mouth trailing along the taut line of erik's shoulder. plus, i really like feeling you inside me like that. it's kind of kinky\\u2026 is that so\\u2026 erik smirks, turning around to face charles and cupping charles' face in his hands. well, don't think that gets you out of me being inside you in the other way - we did have a deal, after all. ah, i suppose we did\\u2026 charles grins, his eyes wide and mischievous. well, i'm a man of my word if nothing else\\u2026 he adds, licking his lips and just starting to drop to his knees, before erik grips charles under the arms to stop him. clothes off first\\u2026 erik requests firmly, trying to look authoritative and unaffected rather than like someone completely besotted with lust. charles quirks an eyebrow in response but heeds erik's words, beginning to slowly unbutton his shirt as he stares into erik's eyes. of course, charles can't just perform the act without being a fucking tease about it, and he undoes his buttons slowly, torturously, flashing erik glimpses of creamy white skin adorned with a constellation of freckles as he gradually shrugs the garment off. when his chest is bared charles next turns his attention to his trousers, but doesn't just remove them quickly either. he draws his fingertips slowly over his belt buckle first, knowing that erik can feel the warmth of charles' hands against the metal, and smirking as erik lets out a barely-suppressed groan in response. something wrong, dear? charles asks, his sweet face the epitome of faux innocence as he draws his belt slowly through the clasp of the buckle before removing it completely. erik practically wants to growl in frustration, and drag charles over to the bed to hurry things along, but erik has learned that- when it comes to charles- the wait is always undeniably worth it, even if it means erik suffers from a low burn of arousal that makes his cock strain uncomfortably against the confines of his trousers. besides, within a moment the wait is over, and charles is letting his clothing fall to the floor to stand before erik with his hands clasped together in front of himself- dropping his gaze and appearing almost nervous, almost shy. it's remarkable to erik that, after so many encounters, after all the things charles has let erik do to him, he still has the capacity to be somewhat bashful- as if erik hasn't seen every inch of charles' skin before now, or mapped it out with his tongue. charles isn't even fully nude, but the sight is completely captivating nonetheless- particularly as erik can see the prominent line of charles' erection just visible behind his clasped hands, pushing up against the loose material of his boxer shorts. charles' underwear is new- erik can tell, he has seen every aspect of charles' wardrobe enough to recognise any changes, and besides- erik would know if he has seen this particular garment before\\u2026 erik laughs softly, reaching down to grasp both of charles' hands and gently tugging them apart. well, these are certainly interesting\\u2026 erik grins, hooking one finger into the front of charles' boxer shorts and running it along the hem, drawing it over the sensitive skin above charles' groin and causing charles to inhale a shaky breath in response. the boxer shorts charles is wearing are grey, and are adorned with a pattern of tiny red magnets and yellow lines presumably supposed to represent a magnetic pull. erik has become accustomed to the eccentricities of charles' wardrobe, which appears to be a mix of decidedly formal shirts, trousers, and cardigans, along with a number of t-shirts emblazoned with scientific slogans and several pairs of gaudy patterned socks, but until this point charles' underwear has always remained entirely neutral in colour and style. erik can only hazard a guess as to why charles has made any changes now. these are for me? erik asks, stepping closer and using his grip on the underwear to pull charles towards himself. everything i do is for you, charles replies with complete conviction, staring down and watching erik's hand as it touches him. do you like them? yes\\u2026 erik says with a smile, drawing his thumb across the point of charles' hip, where the red starburst of a fading bruise on charles' skin marks out the evidence of erik's earlier affections. liebling \\u2026 you're beautiful\\u2026 at that charles looks up, and the experience is like being hit by a thunderbolt. the sunlight glinting through the open window is reflected in charles' eyes, in the dazzling array of blue in his irises- like leagues of colour in the ocean, like water that can sustain life or drown people in its wake. charles smiles at erik seemingly in gratitude, almost like he is surprised at the words, and erik can understand why\\u2026 although erik may regard charles with such affection and devotion it sometimes makes it hard for him to breathe, he has never been very good at expressing himself. words of sentiment, when seldom spoken, are often concealed in erik's native language- reminding him of the last time he was able to speak so freely, when he did so to his mother. there is a wall around erik's heart, and though charles' careful influence has rendered the barrier as increasingly more like a trellis, the gaps in erik's defences can only let so much through. often erik wonders if it is enough, and if his own conservation will drive charles away in the end, but when charles looks at erik like this- with such love and pure faith in his eyes- erik can allow himself to hope for a time that everything will be okay. the moment passes without further comment, more said between their eyes and from their hearts than what can be expressed in words, and then charles is smiling somewhat impishly as he trails his hands down erik's forearms, using his grip on erik's hands to encourage erik to push the underwear down. charles' boxer shorts drop to the floor, and erik barely has time to look before charles is kicking the underwear away and kneeling down on the soft carpet at erik's feet. charles keeps his eyes locked with erik's as he settles down, knees parted, hands resting against the floor, cock hard and standing to attention between his legs. it's a completely bewitching sight, and the desire for erik to hastily wrench free of his clothing has never been more tangible. but this is no longer about what erik can take from charles it's about what he can give to him, and so erik mimics charles' slow seduction from before, and removes his clothing leisurely. on the floor, charles is patient. he watches erik devotedly, like there is no finer sight in the world than erik gradually peeling his t-shirt off and throwing it across the room, like there are untold secrets hidden in erik's trousers and he cannot wait to discover them. erik is having a moment of regret as he unbuttons his jeans, wishing he had taken the time to kiss charles before he settled down, that he had pressed his tongue into charles' eager mouth to taste charles' moans before pushing him to his knees, but it is too late for that now. and besides, when erik slides his trousers and underwear down in one smooth motion, the look on charles' face makes up for it. charles stares at the parts of erik now exposed and his hands immediately tremble like he aches to touch, but whatever desire charles is experiencing is kept in check as he once more looks back up to meet erik's eyes, waiting patiently. no hands, erik says quietly, edging his discarded clothing away with his feet before stepping closer, feeling the plush carpet tickle the space between his toes. charles' eyebrows raise in response, but there is a tell-tale smile in the corner of his mouth that says he likes this game, as he always does, and so he simply shifts a bit closer, and waits. erik cannot fight the urge to touch, so he slides one hand into charles' hair to hold him, to connect with him, and then he moves closer and angles his cock towards charles' waiting mouth. their eye-contact is unbroken as charles parts his lips, as erik feels charles' breath ghost across the head of his cock, as erik begins to push inside, feeling charles' mouth- warm and accommodating- start to surround him. erik uses his hold on charles' hair to guide him, watching transfixed as charles' perfect pink lips slide along the length of his shaft, groaning quietly as charles' clever tongue swirls around the head of his cock. erik can't help but buck his hips at that, and though it's hard to tell completely, erik is sure he can see the flicker of a smile in charles' bright eyes. after a short while erik lets go of his hold on charles' hair and stops rocking forward, watching instead as charles sucks gently on the head of his cock for a while before pushing forward to take the full length in his mouth again, always looking up at erik, always keeping his hands resting against the floor as instructed. erik can only tolerate a few moments of that before he has to touch charles again- stroking one hand through the soft locks of charles' hair as he leans forward to glance down at the smooth line of charles' back, at pale skin interspersed with an array of freckles leading down to the round curve of charles' buttocks. as erik admires the view charles pushes further, causing erik to groan as he feels his cock slip into the tight channel at the back of charles' throat, until charles gasps around the length and has to withdraw, and removes his mouth completely. when erik leans back to look at charles again his face is flushed and he is breathing hard, but he still looks at erik with such love it makes erik's heart ache with feeling in response. erik brushes charles' hair back from his forehead and yearns to kiss him, but charles is once again edging forward to take erik's cock in his mouth before erik can do anything, leaving erik lost to the feelings of pleasure once more as his member slides into wet heat. still, as erik gazes down at charles he smiles at him, murmurs you're amazing\\u2026, and there is a sensation erik can feel coming from charles' mind like a surge of warmth, and erik knows he is happy. as the encounter continues it is very much like a balancing act a reciprocal give-and-take that varies between erik fucking charles' mouth and charles sucking erik's cock, each action causing a hot, tight sensation to build up in the base of erik's member, causing his stomach muscles to flutter promisingly with each lingering thrust. the sensation is heightened by the moans coming from charles that erik feels vibrate through the length of his shaft, moans that are either as a result of charles feeling erik's pleasure rolling off of him in heady magenta waves, or simply because charles is just enjoying himself that much. when erik draws close he once more slides a hand into charles' hair, entwining his fingers in thick brown tendrils whilst using his other hand to grasp hold of his own cock, and starting to stroke. it doesn't take much- charles' mouth is still sucking gently at the head of erik's cock and making erik groan in response- and with charles continuing to look up at erik so devotedly erik feels the pleasure drawn from himself like charles is commanding it, like charles needs it as much as erik does. as erik's breath stutters in his throat charles finally moves his hands, resting one palm on erik's knee and squeezing lightly as erik comes into charles' mouth, watching as erik groans in his pleasure and his speech is lost to intermittent german curses. there is some time after erik has finished coming when charles still keeps his mouth on erik's cock, drawing his lips slowly along the shaft as erik's fingers fumble blindly in charles' hair in his hazy pleasure-state, until erik finally pulls back to let his cock slip out of charles' mouth and charles once more withdraws his hands. for a while erik continues to gaze down at charles, stroking his fingers slowly through charles' hair, thinking about how much he loves and needs this man who will drop to his knees without question, who will give erik everything he wants but can never ask for. it goes much further than the intimacy they've shared, than all the times charles has given his body to erik in wilful subjugation. as charles has already said, everything he does is for erik, and though part of erik cannot understand why charles is able to be so devoted to someone so unworthy, he is grateful for it nonetheless. charles remains sat on the floor looking up at erik, warm sunlight from the window casting a glow upon his face, illuminating every delicate freckle on his skin like fading embers in a fireplace. he is beautiful, and erik reaches down for him without question, slides his hands under charles' arms to pull him up, grasps charles' thighs once charles is upright and hauls the smaller man up- causing charles to let out a slight noise of surprise in response before he adjusts and wraps his legs firmly around erik's waist to hold on. erik carries charles over to the bed and lays down upon it, finding the sheets to be warm against his back courtesy of the rectangle of light that illuminates the bed complimented by the heat from charles' body against his front. it takes a bit of wriggling before erik is able to recline comfortably against the pillows, and then he lays there- still and sated- as charles hums happily and nuzzles his face into erik's neck, his hair brushing against erik's chin as he settles down. there is a low buzz of noise coming from the world outside- faint voices, a pulse of music playing, birds singing. erik registers none of it. his world is inside this room, in his bed, in his arms. nothing else matters. erik trails his fingertips slowly down the curve of charles' spine, smiling as charles lets out a tiny moan and snuggles nearer to erik, like close isn't close enough. erik can feel charles' cock, warm and hard in the tight space in-between their bodies, but charles makes no move to chase his own bliss. it's a marker of the selflessness charles exhibits during every encounter he shares with erik, like he is simply content to be with erik in whatever guise erik chooses, and he expects nothing in return. you're perfect\\u2026 erik murmurs, pressing his knuckles into the dimples above charles' ass. against the side of erik's neck charles lets out a small chuckle. you're only saying that because you've just had your cock in my mouth, he replies. no, charles- i'm saying it because you're extraordinary, erik counters, tilting his face towards charles and sliding one hand into his hair. charles turns his head at that, bathing erik in a bewitching bolt of blue as he gazes into erik's eyes. darling\\u2026 charles says softly, one hand tracing circles on erik's chest with his fingertips. thank you. you're perfect too. erik can't help but scoff in response, and though he immediately sees a flicker of discontent manifest in charles' expression he cannot bring himself to regret his reaction, not even when charles frowns and lifts his head from erik's shoulder, looking down at erik disapprovingly. i wouldn't say it if i didn't mean it, erik. you're perfect to me. there are wealth of reasons erik could offer up for why charles is wrong- all the parts erik can feel within himself like stains on his soul- but erik suspects charles already knows, even if he is too polite to ever mention it out loud. it's likely charles doesn't regard those aspects as imperfections anyway- he has a habit of seeing the good in everything, in everyone. it's one of the things erik loves about him most of all. you're perfect\\u2026 charles whispers, leaning close to place heartfelt kisses to erik's jawline, cheek, forehead- drawing soft lips across erik's skin as his hands move to cup erik's face. erik can feel charles' mind too, like soft light in his periphery, like the sunlight coming in through the open window, warming every part of erik that is cold and dark. erik is close to admitting defeat as he lies there holding charles' waist, but he still huffs quietly under his breath and says you can't say that- you haven't just had your cock in my mouth. of course, charles laughs, his breath warm against erik's temple where charles' mouth is currently pressed. oh, so is that the requirement for uttering that statement after all? charles smirks. well, if you'd like to rectify the situation i'm only too happy to accommodate you\\u2026 he adds, wriggling his hips so that erik feels charles' hard member press more firmly against his stomach. it's as good a way of keeping charles quiet as any, and so erik murmurs alright, and slides his hands down to cup charles' arse to encourage charles to sit up. charles does so, slowly, but once he is seated straddling erik's waist he looks down at erik and says sweetheart, i was joking . i wasn't, erik replies, squeezing charles' buttocks lightly. come here\\u2026 erik pulls charles gently but firmly towards himself, even as charles continues to ask erik if he is sure, until charles is kneeling just in front of erik's face and he grasps the windowsill behind the bed to steady himself. transferring his grip to hold charles' waist, erik pulls charles closer, but bypasses charles' straining erection and presses his mouth instead to the soft skin of charles' groin, causing charles to groan heatedly in response. charles' helpless moans continue for a while as erik trails his tongue over to the crease of charles' thigh, grazes his teeth gently over the point of charles' hip, until finally he withdraws and brings his mouth close to charles' cock at last, and brushes his lips against the sensitive head before opening up and taking charles in. as erik slides his mouth along charles' cock he looks up, seeing that charles' eyes are closed but knowing that his senses are wide open anyway. erik can feel the swell of charles' pleasure through more than just the thick length in his mouth, he can feel it coming from charles' mind like a warm summer breeze gliding through erik's perception continual waves of pleasure cresting across erik's mind as erik sucks earnestly on charles' cock. other than the occasional impassioned moan, charles is still and serene, and the only movement he makes is to reach down with one hand to gently push erik's hair back from his forehead. he looks down at erik and he is glorious- pale and lovely in the sunlight of the afternoon, like he is carved from fine marble, like he is a work of art. when charles comes he does so with a low murmur- his release something erik feels run through every part of himself like a pulse of electricity thanks to the power of charles' telepathy. charles' legs tremble as he shudders through his orgasm so erik uses his hands to hold charles steady, and keeps his mouth moving on charles' cock until charles shifts uncomfortably due to the increased sensitivity, and erik allows him to withdraw. charles moves like he is going to drop to the side to lay next to erik, but instead erik keeps hold of charles and pulls charles back down on top of himself once more, wrapping his arms around charles' back firmly and tilting his head to place a kiss to charles' forehead. there are a few blissful moments when charles lifts his face and kisses erik slowly, passionately, like there is nothing he would rather be doing with his afternoon, with his life, and then he settles down once more with his head resting against erik's chest. you're perfect\\u2026 charles murmurs quietly. for once, erik doesn't argue with him.\",\n          \" kel 25 had a sky the color of charcoal and dirt a few shades darker connie could only tell sky from earth by tracing the high black mounds in the distance, which stood out against the horizon like silhouettes of hulking giants. against the pitch were gleaming white towers, hints of other colors shining like opals in muck. connie looked for the three nested towers of what pearl called the temple of heaven and earth and started walking. the robonoids followed her. her mission was simple retrieve the poofed and damaged gems that had been trapped in the collapsed towers if she could, scout the area if she couldn't, and determine what had caused every gem in the area to suddenly lose contact with homeworld three hundred years ago. connie knew that steven would have preferred to come with her, and that she would have been smarter to wait, but she really hadn't wanted to. it was only a little mission, and there were no documented predators or even multicellular organisms on this planet. if she was injured or got sick, one of the robonoids would sent out a distress message. there wasn't any real danger. plus, she thought as her communicator activated in her ear with a little ding, it wasn't like she was out of range. ... connie? how are you doing so far? is there any sign of hostilities? nothing yet, pearl, connie said, climbing up a few boulders and sliding down the other side with a thump. her boots threw up little puffs of dirt. just a whole lot of atmosphere. this place is really fascinating! it was. gems had surveyed it three centuries ago and had found a wealth of minerals below the surface. they had touched down in their aesthetically-designed ships in all their multitudes, had built temples and towers and had started terraforming- and then it had stopped all at once, every preliminary colonist cutting off contact without warning, and since no one important had been lost, the diamonds had written them off. now, since gems were supposed to have individual worth as sapient beings, the diamonds were finally sending out a search party. three centuries late. maybe that wasn't too long for gems- connie remembered no tv for one thousand years , thank you very much- but it was still discouraging. i suppose it is, came pearl's reluctant response, but you can never be too careful. remember, this is a scouting mission. if you encounter any dangerous situations, you are not to engage. understood, ma'am. connie walked for another hour, digging out a protein bar for quick calories and ducking into shadowed alcoves at any sign of a glint. she found a smashed piece of what looked like a communicator, an intact gem destabilizer, and something that could have been a gem shard but turned out to be a rock. eventually she passed under hulking abandoned injectors, thick bacteriophage drilled into the ground with empty tanks, but there were no holes around them where new gems had been born kel 25, for one reason or another, hadn't birthed any of the new diopsides or jades that it had been annexed to provide. the injectors cast deep shadows over the black soil as the distant twin suns dropped under the horizon, one lagging behind the other like a nervous child. connie checked her rations, figured they were acceptable, and called the robonoids closer so one of them could provide some light. the rest of them continued to range out around her, scanning the ground for shards. the red light didn't damage her night vision, which was why it was so useful it did bathe the alien landscape the color of warm blood, only illuminating the ground a few feet around her before the light faded into red-tinged shadows. connie kept her eyes on the ground, careful not to step in any holes or trip over an unfortunate rock. she'd already tripped once, scraping her elbow, and she wasn't interested in doing it again. only another hour to the temple. she would have transported there directly, but the closest working warp pad had been out in the wastes, and pearl had thought there might be gems who had fled to it before the colony's collapse. kel 25 had an incredibly dense core for its size, which gave it about the gravity of mars, but its days lasted about three hours each. connie had never had a chance of completing the whole expedition in daylight. she wouldn't have had a chance to go on the expedition at all, except that there was a breathable atmosphere and something had already happened to the gems in residence. the hope had been that an organic could scout out the location without being detected immediately as a gem might. connie had mostly jumped on the chance because she'd been stir-crazy it was spring break back home, and she hadn't been to space in ages . the temple came into view, opaline towers gleaming dully in the beams of the robonoids, and immediately one of them froze like a pointing dog, laser fixed on a shining spot on the ground. connie hurried over and plucked the gem up in her hands, then jerked back in disgust and dropped it. sorry, she said awkwardly, even though the gem probably couldn't hear her. she shook the black goop off her palms, grimacing at the sticky thickness of it, and scraped the rest off on a convenient rock, into the earth then, pulling on gloves, she picked up the gem again and scratched the rest of the gunk off. it was a peridot, completely undamaged but covered in dust. she'd never reformed. that didn't bode well. pearl? connie asked, knowing the comm would activate at her name, i found my first gem. she's a peridot, and i don't see any damage, but her gem was covered in this weird black goo. i think it might be keeping her from coming back. she waited for a response, but none was forthcoming. pearl? are you there? connie felt goosebumps rise on her arms. spread out, she said, and the robonoids fanned out around her, illuminating the area. nothing moving but them, no changes close to them but her communicator wasn't working anymore. connie pulled off one of her gloves and reached up to tug it out of her ear, frowned when she noticed the speck of black on its shimmery casing. she hadn't touched it before just then, so where...? she touched the black speck, and it stuck to her finger easily enough, but the comm remained dull. and here she'd thought pearl had only been distracted for a while. stupid . how long had she been out of contact? more importantly, what was this black stuff? she stuffed the peridot's gem in her bag, deciding not to use any more gem tech if she could help it, and came to a decision, feeling remarkably clear-headed. the goop wasn't hurting her, and as long as she didn't get it on the warp pad it should still work, shouldn't it? but every moment these gems spent down here could mean they were deactivated permanently, if they weren't already, and nothing had actually harmed her yet. plus, the more she brought back to the ships, the more chance homeworld's scientists would be able to reverse whatever had happened to these gems. she just had to do her job and scout, like she was supposed to. the temple's entrance was crumbled in on itself, the bridge that led to the rest of it cut off halfway and almost definitely unstable. connie spied a higher level, half-open to the air, and shot her grappling hook to catch in one of the grooves. she tugged- it held- and buckled herself into her climbing harness, making her careful way up the crumbling mosaic of blue diamond. the robonoids followed her closely, but kept to her orders not to touch the walls. she didn't want to risk losing them, too. the second floor yielded more gems, stuck to the floor or walls, alone or in clusters of two or three. connie pried them loose carefully, keeping track- ruby, ruby, lapis lazuli, some kind of quartz- as she placed them in her bag. one of them she tried to pull loose and pulled in half instead, the black goop the only thing keeping it together connie swallowed at that, distant sorrow hitting her like a wave, and packed the two halves carefully, just in case. there weren't any other signs of struggle in the hallways- no scuffs on the walls, no holes in the floor, no broken weapons or shattered pieces. only lights that wouldn't come on, and doors that had to be pried open with a crowbar, and that black dust collecting thick and tarry on every surface. connie dug out her own head lamp, deciding on certainty over retained night vision, and lit her way forward as brightly as she could. it didn't help her unease as much as she'd hoped it would. i don't know if you can hear me, pearl, because i definitely can't hear you, connie said, voice barely a whisper in the empty rooms. it still echoed like a gunshot, deeper into the earth. but you shouldn't send any gems down here. something is seriously wrong. farther in. she started to find hints of life, signs that gems had existed here once a few scraps of someone's pet tech project, gem script scratched into a wall in what looked a lot like graffiti, a chamber full of weapons strewn about like someone had interrupted a sparring match. there was an observation orb lying dead on the ground in one chamber, and a whole line of buttons and screens coated black in another. some parts had script that didn't seem like gem, too, or bits of technology that weren't familiar at all, but connie ignored those she had a mission to complete. she found a sapphire, two other blue gems she couldn't identify, and something she thought was a kind of rutile. her bag grew full, but she kept finding them, so she kept stuffing them in, wincing when they clinked against each other. there were three hundred gems here, at least. she'd never been meant to actually collect this many. she was a scout. going into the earth. she climbed up to the third floor of the temple, forcing open the entrance to the first tower, and had squeezed entirely through before she realized that the only light she had was white. robonoids? no response. she peered back through the slim entrance she'd managed to create, but no red floating orbs were in sight. they must have touched the walls at some point. she breached the next inner sanctum, gazing wide-eyed at the delicate inlays of the ceiling, iridescent white and blue like mermaid's scales there was only one gem in this room- a pearl- and connie had to scrabble with her fingers for twenty minutes to pry it loose. in the inside of the tower, ceiling so high above it was like looking at the sky, she could see more clearly how the blackness had spread it only ebbed into color at over twenty feet in the air, watermarking the walls like flood gauges. connie stared at it, transfixed, then reached up to her comm- except it wasn't in her ear. not on the floor, either, and not outside in the hallway. pearl? she asked aloud, confused, but the comm didn't spark to life. because... it had been disabled, like the robonoids. disabled, and yet she'd kept going deeper into the temple without even marking her way, with only one light and no food and no way out and this hadn't even been her mission - why was she here? she should have turned back as soon as her comm stopped working. she should have reported that something was wrong, taken the first gem she'd found back with her and come back with reinforcements, let homeworld's scientists look over the samples she'd taken so far. she shouldn't have gone deeper in, alone, without giving her friends any way to track her or know what she was doing. something was incredibly wrong. something was... affecting her, maybe, making her think in ways she'd been trained out of. for what purpose? what reason - a glint in the corner of the room. connie moved toward it by rote, but it wasn't a gem it was a little doll with a shard of rock sewn into its chest, with too many arms and a face that wasn't human, wasn't really humanoid at all. connie held it blankly, unable to make her mind work, before something in her screamed pay attention! and she realized that her hand looked wrong. her veins were black . she swallowed back panic and rolled up her sleeve to see the black streaks cutting through her skin all the way up to her elbow, which was stained pitch like she'd dipped it in ink the dark stripes continued to her shoulder and radiated onto her collarbone, the back of her neck, above her breasts. she pressed on the dark parts, but didn't feel pain whatever it was doing to her, discomfort was not a part of it. connie took a deep breath, forced herself to sit down and cross her legs. no more movement until she knew what was going on. that was final . an alien doll. a black gunk that killed gem tech as soon as it touched it. an infection that made her move deeper into the temple and forget what she was supposed to be doing. what did those have in common? what did they mean? unfamiliar script and technology meant... someone else had been there? for long enough that they would have made toys with gem shards and marked up the walls. they had been there, but they weren't there now. possibly the same thing had happened to them as had happened to the homeworld terraformers- as was happening to connie. she needed to get back to the warp pad. connie got to her feet, stuffing the doll in her bag for safekeeping, and stepped back out of the exit. her mind blanked when she stared down both sides of the hallway, but she gritted her teeth and chose a direction, scratching a long line across the wall with the remnants of a gem destabilizer. the temple wasn't that big. she could get out, and if she couldn't she could last a few more hours and follow sunlight to an exit. whatever was happening, it wasn't going to get her. urgency forced her out of the tower, towards the outer parts of the temple, but the hallways all blurred together. had she gone left or right, at that junction? had she been at that junction at all? more discrepancies jumped out at her rotted food beneath the black mold, sketched-out drawings of creatures she'd never seen before, a knife with unfamiliar stylings at the hilt. she kept picking them up to put in her bag before realizing that they weren't gems and didn't need to be taken with her. it took her longer to notice that the reason she couldn't put anything in her bag was because she'd dropped it, somewhere between the inner sanctum and the first tower, and when she did notice it sent a cold trickle of fear down her back. so. she couldn't trust her own perceptions at all, then. what could she do? she took the gem destabilizer- she still had that, at least- and scraped out a message on the walls, as legible as she could make it don't touch. it changes your mind. did that make sens e? did that make any sense at all? would it matter if aliens saw it, since they might not translate? maybe all those inscriptions she'd seen hadn't been graffiti but similar warnings, made useless by language barriers. connie wished she wasn't too hyped on adrenaline and nerves to be fascinated by what could be an alien rosetta stone. she finished the message and stepped back, turning to the exit- except she didn't know where the exit was. she didn't- but there was an exit. but she had a mission? no, the mission was to- to scout , to get out, to go deeper into the temple and into the earth . i'm not doing that, connie said to no one, but she found herself following a path anyway, stepping past discarded gems and organic scraps. connie trailed the gem destabilizer across the wall whenever she thought of it, but mostly she followed the path. her feet were made for the path, or must have been, because it had been followed before. she could see prints in the black beneath her boots. her hand caught at one of the doorways, gripping white-knuckled, and she took advantage of the momentary confusion to wrench herself back and sink to the floor, bury her head in her knees. stay still , she told herself. stay still. when you get lost you have to stay still until someone finds you, you (deeper into the earth) have to wait for rescue. something's in my head, ma'am, she said aloud, because she thought she should. i'm compromised. can you find me? somehow she was standing again, and then she was moving. her feet hurt, but her pace didn't slow. the headlamp flickered off, finally running out of battery. she didn't know if that meant it was daylight. it didn't matter. she had a path. (into the earth) she had a path and she would follow it, if her feet would stop stumbling, if her hands would stop catching at things, if her knees would stop crumbling when they didn't even hurt. again she was kneeling, scratching something into the black gunk st st st st over and over again, not even a full word. stop? stay? stretch? steven, she tried, but it didn't make sense why she'd be writing his name anywhere. he wasn't coming with her into the earth. he was- in space, in orbit, at home. on the other planet. not this planet but a different, vaster one, a stranger one with lighter soils. the walls lost their gem-patterns and became dark and musty, close to her shoulders so she had to turn sideways to get through the passages. there must have been light coming from somewhere she could make out shapes in the dark, and she didn't trip even once. the sides of the tunnels expanded and contracted under her fingers when she pressed against them. they were warmer than her hands. into the earth for hours and hours, until her stomach felt tight, until her feet cracked and bled, until her ankles blistered against her socks and her legs ached, following the path laid out for her. somewhere she dropped the gem destabilizer, too, but she didn't mind it was less weight to carry. finally the walls were more red than black, bathed crimson by a warm, beckoning light connie stepped out into an open chamber, a cavern so wide that its ceiling was like a stalactite-laden sky, and stared in wondering horror. once, connie had seen the crystal heart that powered the temple back in beach city, bright pink and glassy this heart was a deeper red, so vast it stretched from one horizon of the cavern to another, broader than all of beach city combined. gleaming bitter red, glowing with blood-warmth and pulsing, humming through her flesh until she felt loose like wet meat, flushed all in black and blood. others were there, too, strange beings with too many arms and carapaces, creeping along the walls or skittering on the floor. connie couldn't move, could only stare with blown-wide pupils at the massive beating heart, the lovely sanguine center of the planet, could only absorb the sight of it. her thoughts ebbed and flowed, jumbling into each other until some inner levy broke and sloshed them loose then she crumbled to her knees, suddenly light-headed, and said, wait. i don't- this isn't my planet. it was, though, came the thought. it was her planet. her tunnels, her beating heart to serve. it thrummed through her like her own pulse, drove her blood to warm her. connie shuddered, hugging herself, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it was right, that it had- those gems, she tried again, but the thought had already left her. determination made her press on, made her gather them back to her like scraps of paper. she would say what she meant to say. those gems, you- hurt them. you're the planet. you hurt these people. some of the aliens came closer to her, catching her by the arms and pulling her back into a side of the cavern, into an alcove in the wall, into the earth. they herded her into the dirt and she kicked, bit at them, lizard-brain terror catching where coherence couldn't reach. but there were so many of them. so many, blank and empty-eyed, rotten black and sloughing skin into the dirt to feed the earth. they pushed her in and moved close, pulling strands from their bodies and wrapping her, binding her as the heart pulsed through her mind and made her limp and unresisting. they cocooned her away from the light. connie's hands were trapped against her chest, fingers brushing the heavy strands as they smothered her she pushed against them just a little, curious, but couldn't press past that. into the earth. into the planet. this wasn't something she should fight. the heart beat through her in a lazy percussion, expanding and contracting scarlet on the insides of her eyelids when she blinked. she closed her eyes without meaning to and breathed slowly, in and out like she was meditating, until her mind drifted away. the heartbeat drove her blood to warm her. * silence. * connie opened her eyes with a gasp, wriggling in her bonds, and immediately tried to scream. her body didn't respond to her commands, though, only moved like it had a mind of its own, and fear suffused her like cold water. she'd- been stupid, cut herself and not noticed , gotten mind-controlled and now it was too late - the cocoon was dark and suffocating, red light bleeding through the fibers and making her skin glow dark, making the streaks in her veins stand out. the heartbeat pounded through her skull, disturbing now instead of comforting she tried to block it out, humming in her mind, but it bashed through her thoughts like they didn't exist, made her brain feel like it was welling up with blood. all crimson, behind her eyes, all saying go to sleep, leave it be, sink into the earth but she couldn't, she wouldn't, if she did she would cease to exist . she threw every part of her will at her body, lashing out for control of one eyelid, one finger, one muscle fiber. it was as useless as fighting an ocean. before, when the heart had been leading her, she'd been able to subvert it now it was like it had taken her brain and left her severed from every nerve ending, a vestigial organ just waiting to be culled. like being a puppet. but she couldn't be, she didn't want to die, she had so much to do still- connie tried to scream again, tried to cry, tried to thrash and escape but her body wasn't hers anymore, was just moving on its own like an automaton - hold on, her voice rasped, sounding surprised, and she froze. that tone of voice- was that-? am i connie? relief surged through her, and she collapsed back into the background, desperately grateful. not the heart. not a mindless puppet for an alien planet, not a meatsuit for breaking gems and killing shipwrecked aliens. her body was in safe hands. in steven's hands. her best friend didn't seem to know what to do with himself at first he used her fingers to press against the skin of the cocoon, blinking slowly, then forced through the fibers with her shoulder. the push made him stumble painfully into the ground, and he righted himself immediately, staring at her black-streaked hands. they were shaking . what's going on? i'm being mind-controlled by the planet, connie tried to say, but steven only turned to look around the cramped tunnel, obviously confused. he couldn't hear her, connie realized with a start. he couldn't hear her at all . but then how would he know where to go, where to pick up the injured gems? steven! steven, i'm right here, you have to listen to me! nothing. connie despaired as he stared at her surroundings, feeling her eyes go wide with horror. have you been trapped here all this time? connie, i'm so sorry, i- i should have come sooner- he cut off, tears pricking at her eyes, but connie's mind was blank. what? how long has it been? steven? her body continued to move without her permission, steven wincing at her bloodied feet and staggering with one hand to the wall. the tunnel they'd herded her into was so tight that it scraped against both her shoulders, constricting her chest when she inched sideways, and connie was ninety percent sure that it had deepened after they'd cocooned her in. she felt steven shudder at the claustrophobic fit. crimson light glowed at the entrance to the larger chamber, filling the doorway with red like a giant eye steven faltered, shrinking back, but squared her shoulders. he knew as well as connie did that there wasn't another way out. he stepped into the beating heart's chamber and froze up completely, pulse going rapid. connie winced back from the thrum of influence that pulsed through her, marshaling her thoughts together as her only defense steven, still taking in the chamber, saw the carapace-aliens and shrank back into the tunnel. that's not good, he whispered. were they kidnapped, too? if you'd actually hear me i could help you, connie couldn't help thinking, nervous and snappy with it, but of course it didn't reach him. steven hid in the tunnel until one of the aliens stepped into it and stopped at the sight of him, then said tentatively, hi. i'm steven. can you, uh- can you understand me? the alien regarded him blankly, head lolling and eyes rotten black out of its head, thorax falling apart like an ant possessed by fungi. black sludge dripped off it and plopped onto the floor one of its many arms hung limp and snapped-off at its side. too far gone for thought, connie figured, and felt steven mirror the conclusion. his arm rose up defensively in front of him as the alien approached, then faltered when no shield appeared. she could feel the realization steal over him no powers, no familiarity with the body, only whatever connie had left in her after being held captive for what had apparently been more than a day. steven, you have to listen to me! you don't know the way out! can you hear me? he pressed anyway. are you still alive in there? he reached out- steven, what- and touched the zombie alien's side, making a face at the sludge coating connie's hand. the alien paused, body stiffening- connie felt a burst of incredulity- then flew into motion, grabbing connie's wrist and slamming her against the wall. steven yelped in her voice and kicked out at it, wriggling loose and ducking beneath its claws, but her body was weak. other aliens wrestled it onto its knees. they held her arms behind her back and forced them- forced steven - to look into the beating heart. it was blood and warmth and vitality so intense it hurt to witness was glowing brighter than a star, washing the world crimson like a moonset, feeding its life into the dirt and the rock and its trillions of spores. its arteries reached into the core of the planet, its capillaries fine and fast beneath its crust, its lungs molten in the mantle of the world. in the high chamber it was the world, so large it reminded connie of steven's description of the cluster, and its veins reached over connie's head like massive tree trunks sunk deep into the earth. deeper into the earth. she was- this was her planet, she belonged to it- she felt her fists clench. you can't have her, steven growled with her voice. she doesn't belong to you. none of these people do! something thrummed, pulsed, throbbed through her flesh and pulled it apart like cooked muscle, loose and stringy connie felt nauseous and transfixed, overwhelmed, but steven only said heatedly, she doesn't belong to anyone. the hive-aliens crept closer, stained with black goop and dripping it. i need you to let her go, okay? i know it must have hurt when homeworld started drilling into you, but connie didn't have anything to do with that. she's just here on a rescue mission. it doesn't care, connie tried to say, but the words wouldn't come. steven, what are you doing? the heart reached into her head and twisted, dragging a scream out of her that never left her lips. connie lashed out at it, trying to make her thoughts a sword, but it batted her aside like she was nothing, smothered her thoughts until she couldn't breathe. what are you- stop that! steven sounded panicked. could he feel it, could he feel her? could he hear her? the heart pulsed brighter in retaliation for his command, searing out every thought in connie's head even as she spat and cursed at it, threw all she had into resisting, but it wasn't enough and the agony was blinding, steven steven please- i said stop it! steven screamed in connie's voice, and the red light snapped back and dimmed like it had been struck. connie felt strange, like there was something overlapping with her body, something new coursing through her like fresh energy- and then the sensation disappeared, feet moving rapidly beneath her, and she realized that steven was running. running the wrong way. connie tried to lurch her feet in the right direction, jerk a hand, anything, but her body wasn't her own steven had taken it over completely. she settled for yelling at him, trying to get him to hear something, but she was too late. her body ran up to a dead end, panting and shaking, and she felt her face fall. steven whirled around, but the aliens were already blocking the exit, clustered against the light. we can still fight! she yelled, but he was already shrinking back, hesitance making him slow. he could heal anything. if he could just get her body to the surface he could resurrect her, anything would be better than being an eternal mind-slave to a sociopathic planet, seriously , steven! one of the aliens jerked closer on rickety legs, and steven dove under it, rolling onto his feet and dashing down another hallway. he bounced off the breathing walls in his haste, shuddering at their warmth, and took passages wildly, darting back and forth like he was under a spell. connie didn't understand until steven muttered, come on, garnet, doubling back and narrowly dodging more of the hive-aliens, and then she realized it was future vision. she hadn't known he could carry that over into another body. her feet were bleeding worse now, but there was no time to stop steven sprinted into gem-made tunnels at last, taking turns like he'd lived in the temple all his life, and tripped over her bag, slamming hard into the ground. he scrambled upright immediately, tense like he was about to keep running, but stopped and stared at the bag for a second before grabbing it and slinging it over her shoulder. connie sighed in internal relief. finally her body wouldn't move any farther, muscles shaky and unable to hold her weight, and steven wedged her into a small alcove at the temple's edge and hid, ears straining for any sign of pursuit. it took a while for connie to push past her exhaustion to notice he was speaking. no- he was crying, tears streaming down her cheeks and leaving trails in black dust. please don't be too late, he was whispering, hugging her knees. i'm sorry i didn't notice, i'm sorry, please don't be too late, you'll be okay, i know you will- and connie hadn't thought about how it must seem, that he'd taken over her body when he must have only wanted to contact her, but now it was all too obvious. i'm fine, i'm right here, we're almost out, she tried to push at him, but he didn't hear her. he just kept weeping, quiet and terrified, completely unaware of her presence. i'm gonna get you out of here, he promised, we have a plan, okay, we just need to get to the cliff and we can get out, take all these gems with us, you just have to be alive in there, okay? don't be a zombie. it's hard to be jam buds with a zombie. believe me, steven, i'm trying my best. eventually she heard scuffling below them steven heard it too, scrambling to her feet just as a horde of aliens erupted from the dirt, and then they were running even as connie felt like she was about to collapse. the aliens were fast, wherever they'd been from. they moved like spiders or scorpions, skittering in quick tiny steps, and connie's exhausted body wasn't quick enough to outrun them. in her mind the heart pulsed come back come back come back, but she didn't have to listen, didn't even have to resist listening her body wasn't in either of their control. the aliens chased them to the west of the temple, away from the warp pad and to the jagged hills connie was only starting to remember the maps she'd reviewed when steven crested a hill and she realized they were heading straight toward a cliff. was this what you were talking about? steven? her friend froze, staggering like he saw something else, then- stumbled, faltered- connie leaped to her feet, adrenaline coursing through her veins, and whirled to see a horde of aliens encroaching. her brain felt empty and strange, echoey, and she couldn't find any trace of steven anywhere. steven? she shouted through her rasping throat. steven, are you there? what am i supposed to do from here? did you see something else? future vision could have told him this would kill her, or that his body was under attack, or any number of things. what had made him leave so suddenly? what had he seen, what was he planning to do? was the cliff still part of the plan? it didn't matter either way connie was cornered, and she'd never been clued in in the first place. she backed up as the horde approached, snarling and lashing out at reaching appendages, and thought, come on, garnet. thought he was heading toward the cliff, he was running full tilt and stopped suddenly, if i'm caught i'm dead anyway and steven won't let me die- the cliff. the cliff was the plan, and steven hadn't been planning to stop, and anyway she was out of options. if she died, they could retrieve her body and resurrect her if she broke every bone in her body, steven could heal her. the only unacceptable option was being enslaved by the beating heart, and she already knew steven could pull her out if that happened. it was like one of the trust falls that their gym teachers made them do in school close your eyes, spread your arms, lean back. let gravity take you. if you were lucky- if the other person was strong enough, was paying attention- they would catch you. was steven strong enough? was he paying attention? connie already knew the answer to both was yes . you should have asked nicely, she rasped at the encroaching horde, daring to smirk, and stepped backwards into open air.\"\n        ],\n

'ello shouyou, atsumu mumbles into the consult room floor. have you gotten into trouble again? hinata asks, directing his question down at tuna, as atsumu continues to lie prone on the floor. tuna pants happily at him, before trying to stick his nose into his pockets. i don't keep biscuits in there, hinata scolds, gently pushing at tuna's enormous head until the dopey dog moves away. ya shouldn't give him anythin', he doesn't deserve it. hinata raises an amused eyebrow as atsumu clambers ungracefully back to his feet and shoots a dirty look at his disobedient dog. well. disobedient for atsumu, anyway. whenever osamu accompanied him down to the office tuna was always beautifully behaved. the same went for atsumu's boyfriend. he just seemed to be deaf to any commands issued by his actual owner. what happened? hinata prompts, when no immediate problem is presented for him to solve. went runnin' off where he shouldn't have been in the woods again he's got some sorta cut on his shoulder. i dunno what from. i just saw the blood and called. it's always somethin'. hinata hums thoughtfully and settles his coffee cup back down on the side by his computer, turning his attention tuna. sit, he commands softly, smiling as tuna dutifully lowers his haunches, and starts rifling around in his thick fur where atsumu is pointing. tuna, ever since he was small, has had a very bad habit of finding any and all sharp objects that could possibly exist on his walks and bodily crashing into them. hinata's lost count of the amount of stitches he's placed into him over the years. from paws to ears, anywhere that it's possible to get a cut, tuna has achieved it. it's not that atsumu is neglectful it's just tuna is incredibly clumsy. oh, found it, hinata murmurs as he finally parts tuna's coat in the right place, revealing a shallow wound in the meat of his shoulder. it's quite superficial. does it need stitches? atsumu sighs, resting one hand on the examination table and rubbing his temple with the other. not\\u2026 necessarily. hinata tilts his head this way and that, considering. he could get away with staples the edges are neat, there's no damage to the deeper tissues\\u2026 a clip and a clean, it should heal up fine. but tuna is a very active, very boisterous dog who isn't likely to sit still and rest for the next week or so that the staples would need to stay in. stitches would be more secure, he finally says over his shoulder, unless you've got some way of keeping him calm? i can put staples in\\u2026 have ya met him? he's an idiot, atsumu grumps, rounding the examination table to ruffle his dog's ears, a bit of fondness seeping in through his annoyance. tuna wiggles in place, completely oblivious to the problems he's causing. what about if he stays with osamu? hinata suggests, rising up from his crouch to busy himself by his work surface gathering what he needs to clean the wound. while atsumu's boyfriend had good control over him hinata has no idea how, atsumu changes the story each time he still lived with atsumu. whereas osamu is by himself, and tuna would, hopefully, be a little more inclined to behave without atsumu around to cause him to forget all self-control. atsumu scowls harder at the mention of his twin. the favours he'll want from me\\u2026 what do you hate more? favours or paying out for another stitch-up? now, see, ya only say that because you've only seen 'samu when he's bein' nice. he ain't nice to me. hinata resists the urge to roll his eyes. he's known both the miya twins for many years now he and atsumu lived together for a while during college and he knows full well they're as bad as each other when they want to be. but he'll never forget that one time, when he was barely out of vet school and more than a little terrified, when tuna had eaten a bone and needed surgery to have it removed when it got stuck. how he had been so nervous to be the one tasked with saving his friend's dog, and how it had been osamu that had held atsumu's hand the entire day both literally and figuratively - and kept his brother calm so that hinata could concentrate. atsumu could complain as much as he wants, but osamu has never truly let him down. speaking of- how's your little\\u2026 arrangement goin'? hinata grunts his confusion at the question, not looking up from where he's beginning work on clipping away the fur surrounding tuna's wound. by the time he's got it all cleaned up atsumu should've come to a decision on what he wants him to do. it'll probably be the staples option, he's just working his way up to actually admitting it. atsumu waves vaguely at the coffee cup by hinata's computer. the free coffees. 'samu told me about your uhh\\u2026 benefactor. oh! hinata glances up at atsumu as he reaches for his cleaning materials in a little bowl. he'll have to ask atsumu to turn around in a moment though, because he needs to attach a needle to end of a saline bag to flush the wound properly and atsumu is terribly needle-phobic. (atsumu denies this vehemently. hinata dutifully says nothing while his friend does breathing exercises in the corner whenever tuna needs an injection.) yeah it's really nice of them! hinata says, louder to be heard over the buzzing of his clippers as he trims away the fur around the wound. i was a little hesitant at first but osamu talked me into it. said the person who offered was really genuine about it. he just wants the business, atsumu mutters, before saying louder ya don't find it weird a client's buyin' you infinite coffees? hinata doesn't answer this at first. instead he wipes away the loose fur, and gets to work with his cleaning. tuna sits perfectly still, fixated on the small jar of treats hinata keeps by his computer - oblivious to what's going on by his shoulder. the thing is\\u2026 hinata has a hunch as to where the coffees are coming from. or who they're coming from, he should say. the timing from when he'd had that incredibly busy day and had had nothing to eat until late afternoon to suddenly being offered all the coffee and food he wants the morning after\\u2026 it couldn't be coincidence. and yet it still seems so fanciful he doesn't want to dwell on it too much, just in case his hunch is completely wrong. shouyou. atsumu looms over his shoulder to get his attention, frowning hard. i mean, not really\\u2026 they want to, right? hinata offers, focusing on his work to avoid the judgemental stare aimed his way. remember that time ya got bitten by that parrot - of all things - and wouldn't accept the lift to the hospital from its owner even though you were bleedin' all over the place? mmmm\\u2026 hinata hums, feeling a frown of his own starting to build across his forehead. he reaches for his needle and saline bag, pulling the cap off with his teeth and making a show of sticking it into the bag. atsumu straightens abruptly and takes vivid interest in a poster about dental health on the wall. so that i, he continues, louder, had to take ya myself , two hours after the damn bird bit ya, because you wouldn't take the lift? 'didn't want to take advantage' i think your words were. i didn't! hinata insists, indignant, almost spraying tuna's entire leg with saline as he whips his head around to glare at atsumu. his friend still has his back turned to him though irritatingly so he huffs and refocuses his attention. it wasn't her fault her parrot did that! she didn't have to\\u2026 and this guy doesn't have to buy ya coffee, atsumu points out, turning back around and making a show of leaning against the examination table. 'samu said he was your type\\u2026 lemme guess, you think he's cute, right? hinata grips his saline bag so hard he drenches his knees, a puddle forming on the floor. tuna pants happily and rises from his sitting position to bend his head and lick the salty liquid from the floor, tail wagging madly. i don't think he's cute! hinata squawks, steadying tuna with one hand on his collar so the dog doesn't wander too far away. then clears his voice and flicks his eyes to the door to his consult room, acutely aware he might be overheard. i don't, he hisses, when atsumu just raises an eyebrow at him. but ya know who i'm talkin' about, don't ya? hinata twists the now empty saline bag between his hands, his knuckles going white as he mauls the plastic. a furious blush burns his cheeks for a second, before he sighs loudly in defeat and throws his used materials into the various bins around his room with a flourish. atsumu did always manage to draw out the dramatics in him. yes, okay? yes, hinata groans when atsumu rises up from the table and saunters over to him, looking unbearably smug. because that really is the confirmation isn't it? he doubts osamu would've whipped out a photo for his brother, but if he was able to describe him well enough that atsumu has an idea of what he looks like then it must be\\u2026 yes to ya know who i mean or yes that he's cute? atsumu needles. hinata does glare at him this time, the daggers landing as he stalks to his treat jar and determinedly feeds tuna two biscuits. it's alright. they're low fat and tuna is massive. he's not a hypocrite. i'm getting my stapler, he snaps, stomping from the room. atsumu's voice floats after him, switching from sly to whiny in an instant. what! i didn't agree to owin' 'samu a favour! hinata ignores him as he storms down the hall to fetch what he needs. not five minutes later, he's placed a neat, short row of staples, fast and efficient. tuna, in hinata's professional opinion, seems to be utterly immune to pain. it's not the first time he's thought this, considering the amount of times he's patched him back together again, but it never ceases to amaze him how completely unfussed by everything the shepherd is. the staples went in easily tuna didn't even blink at their insertion and hinata sits back to assess his handiwork. one of his neatest jobs, he thinks tuna certainly injures himself enough to provide a good amount of practice. so i need him back in- -ten days, yeah i know, atsumu grumbles, still grouchy that he has to ask his brother for a favour. and call osamu when you leave, hinata adds, with a layer of sternness to his voice. atsumu grabs for tuna's lead, ruffles his ears and murmurs some quiet words of praise, before he falls silent, his face stormy and brow creased. hinata tilts his head at the sight, feeling worry start to build. atsumu could sometimes throw a tantrum about giving his brother any sort of advantage, but the truth is the two did rely on each other a lot. normally, atusmu's protestations are merely surface level whinging, and nothing more. it can't be any worse than when he got you to mop the coffee shop floors for a week- hinata starts to say, trying to lighten the mood that his friend has found himself in, when atsumu suddenly interrupts him. are ya eatin' properly now? hinata blinks, thrown. i always eat properly, he says slowly, because he does. his diet's exceptional. \\u2026 when he has time to eat, that is. \\u2026 oh, he says, just as slowly, as realisation dawns. atsumu ticks an eyebrow up at him, silently urging him to continue. i\\u2026 yeah, i guess, hinata mumbles, running a hand through his hair in his sudden fluster. it is certainly much easier to call the shop and get lunch arranged osamu has many healthy and delicious options, it's never hard to pick than it is to find time to prepare meals. plus with the current\\u2026 arrangement, there's always sustenance nearby, if he needs it. you should just ask him out on a date already. i'll do it for ya, if you're chicken. hinata bristles immediately. he's a client! he hisses, just remembering to temper his volume in time. i can't ask my clients out on dates! ya think he's cute and judgin' by how he buys ya coffee and lunch every day he's probably pretty sweet on you too. can't see this blowin' up in your face if i'm honest, shouyou, atsumu says, his voice an odd mix of falsely mild and genuinely sincere. he does this sometimes. when was the last time ya saw someone, anyway? okay, time to go, i have other patients to see, hinata shoots back, this time letting his voice climb up loud. just the thought of his dating history or complete lack of, these days is enough to make humiliation curl hot in his belly. yet alone discussing it in the middle of his working day. he makes flapping motions with his hands at atsumu, urging him towards the door. can't stand around chatting to you all day. call osamu and then come back and see me for those staples to come out, okay? bye bye. call the guy, atsumu insists, still undeterred even when he's being forcibly shoved from the room. hinata kicks open the door, pauses to rub both hands behind tuna's huge, soft ears, coos at him for being such a good boy, and then directs the shepherd's attention to the flock of crows dancing around in the parking lot, their cries audible even through the waiting room's windows. tuna's tail starts wagging frantically immediately and he launches, barrelling towards the windows instantly. atsumu lets out an undignified shriek as tuna's lead is pulled tight and he's dragged bodily over the threshold. tuna! shouyou! bye atsumu! hinata sings cheerfully, waving as tuna hurtles towards the windows, atsumu in tow. it's fine. the waiting room's not long enough for tuna to do any real damage. shouyou! atsumu hollers back, trying to look stern, but fails miserably as tuna shoots towards another window, whining in his impatience to get to the birds. hinata snickers as atsumu trips over one of the waiting room chairs in a vain attempt to control his overly excitable dog, and once again face plants onto the floor. the room's only other occupant an elderly man with a matching elderly cat blinks vaguely as atsumu sprawls across the ground. defeated, atsumu lets go of tuna's lead, letting his dog burn out his energy staring at the birds, and seems to give himself a moment to just lie prone on the floor, before he eventually clambers to his feet. yachi gives him a bemused look from the reception desk as he saunters towards her, trying to look nonchalant as he brushes off his clothes. call him! atsumu shouts over his shoulder, ignoring tuna's whimpering and scrabble of paws against the window panes. hinata resists the urge to roll his eyes and moves to gather up the older gentleman's cat carrier, offering an arm to aid the man in standing. he calls me! he shouts back, once his new client is upright and shuffling towards his consult room. he just catches a glimpse of atsumu's bewildered expression as he slips back into his room, and snickers as he hears his name being called indignantly as he closes the door behind him. it's nice to have friends like that, the old man says mildly, a small smile on his face as hinata gently places the cat carrier on his examination table. hmm\\u2026 sometimes, hinata replies, eyes twinkling. now, tell me what's wrong with whiskers\\u2026 an hour or so later, hinata is just typing up the last of his notes on his computer, wondering which lab result is the most prudent for him to look into first, when the now empty coffee cup by his computer catches his eye. pausing in his writing, hinata taps his fingertips idly against his keyboard, unable to stop the smile that stretches its way across his face. hinata really can't do anything on his end he has a professional stance to maintain but well, if he was asked instead\\u2026 he would certainly give it some consideration. hinata? hinata blinks and swivels on his stool to face yachi, standing in the doorway. kageyama's on the line for you. ahh, right on time, hinata grins, and grabs the empty coffee cup to toss it into the bin from his seat. he reaches for the phone in his room and takes the call, holding the receiver between his shoulder and ear so that his hands are free to bring up carrot's notes. it won't be the question he's hoping for the queries about the new problem kageyama has run into this week but hinata has long since given up denying these phone calls from the grumpy, somehow adorably awkward musician, all add up to be one of the highlights of his week. kageyama, he says once the line connects, what do you need to ask me today?\",\n          \" after knowing charles for so many months, erik is sure he knows everything there is to know about him. erik knows charles is smart. he knows charles is kind. he knows that charles is a remarkably powerful mutant, that he enjoys tea, that he plays rugby, that he sometimes laughs in his sleep. he knows that charles' ribs are ticklish, that there is a small birthmark on the top of charles' right buttock in the shape of a tiny heart, that charles' toes cramp when he comes. erik knows charles loves him. but what erik doesn't know is where charles goes every wednesday afternoon. at first erik doesn't even realise that charles' absence on those days is telling. it has taken such a long time for the two of them to reach a place where they are in an actual committed relationship, and previously their encounters were so unregimented and sporadic that erik never really noticed that none of those meetings took place on a wednesday between 1pm and 3pm. but then, erik realises. erik is in the library with charles that day, writing up some notes from the lecture he had in the morning. at the university charles and erik both attend there are no classes on wednesday afternoons, meaning most students spend their free time studying or relaxing or drinking. it is a beautiful sunny day and erik is considering going for a walk with charles, or perhaps driving him to the secluded hillside spot that has become their special place, or maybe taking charles back to his dorm room so he can spend some time in bed with charles laid out beneath him. but before erik can get out the words to vocalise any of the options charles is standing up from the table, shoving his books into his bag, and announcing his plans to leave. you're going? erik asks, shooting charles a curious glance. mm? oh, yes- sorry, darling, i have somewhere i need to be. you had somewhere you needed to be last wednesday\\u2026 erik replies, thinking of the previous week when he'd invited charles to join himself and the brotherhood on an outing to the cinema before charles had declined the offer. there is an immediate pang of jealous in erik's chest, splintering into his heart with echoes of it's happening, you knew this couldn't last, he's found someone better, you don't deserve him\\u2026 for some time erik has known that charles is not his equal, that charles is brighter, smarter, kinder than erik could ever hope to be- that his words and actions make him worthy that he deserves more than erik can provide. in that moment part of erik wants to say nothing else, wants to allow charles to leave and simply go home alone to dwell in silence and solitude. but charles has made erik promise long ago that erik would not hide, and though it is difficult, though erik wants to protect himself from everything that could expose his vulnerabilities, he is trying to be better- for charles. are you keeping something from me\\u2026? erik asks, getting out that much but leaving off the end of the sentence that says if you are i don't really want to know, because if you leave me you'll destroy me. charles pauses, looking at erik as he tucks an unruly lock of hair behind his ear. charles' hair is too long again- a chaotic brown mop atop his head- but erik likes it. he likes the way charles' hair falls against his chest when charles falls asleep in his arms, and the way charles' hair brushes against the inside of his thighs when charles kisses him there. not keeping something from you, no\\u2026 charles replies cautiously. where i go is not a secret, i just haven't mentioned it because i wasn't aware you wanted to know. why wouldn't i want to know? no reason\\u2026 erik, look- although i may think about you all the time i don't always take care to plot your reactions to certain things, or to assume what you do or don't want. please don't interpret my failure to disclose this particular piece of information as some sort of attempt to deceive you. i would never lie to you, darling, or keep anything from you. but this is the first time you've asked me where i'm going so it didn't seem necessary to mention it until now. alright\\u2026 erik says eventually, feeling the tight knot of dread in his chest begin to dissipate at charles' reassuring words. so, where are you going? charles smiles at that, picking up the last of his books in one arm and extending the other hand towards erik, before waggling his fingers in invitation. come and see. half an hour later erik is sat next to charles in a train that carries them across the city. normally erik doesn't particularly enjoy public transport, preferring the convenience of his car above all else, but there is something comforting about being enclosed by metal all around feeling the wheels of the train glide easily along the tracks as it takes them to their destination. next to erik, charles is scribbling notes into a notepad- words and numbers and symbols spilling out across the page like extracts of charles' mind expressed in untidy black ink. erik will never cease to be amazed at the speed of charles' brain, at the ease of his thoughts, at the way he can make connections with a single step that others cannot reach in a giant leap. he is brilliant. what's even more remarkable is the fact that he is erik's. as erik watches charles he leans over, slides one arm into the space between charles' back and the upholstered seat of the train, and slips his thumb under charles' shirt to gently draw circles against the skin of charles' spine. charles murmurs in response, pausing his work to turn and look at erik, and smiling affectionately. using his telepathy charles presses a soft kiss against erik's mind, and the warmth of the gesture remains evident all the way through the rest of the journey. sometime later erik is standing next to charles as they both look up at a large building. in the warm air there is the sound of police sirens nearby and the low rumble of music playing punctuated by the occasional enthusiastic shout. across the street from where they stand the neighbouring block of flats has numerous broken windows and there is a car up on blocks in front of the building, and erik suddenly understands why charles would not let him drive. of all the places erik might have imagined charles might be spending his wednesday afternoons, erik never pictured this. simply from the way charles speaks it is clear he has an air of class about him, and from what charles has disclosed about his childhood erik knows he originally came from money, even if he is no longer as wealthy as he once was. knowing that information, erik can't help but be surprised that charles has been evidently spending his free time in a clearly disadvantaged neighbourhood, the only question is why. then erik sees the sign that displays the building's means of business, and he understands. for the rest of the afternoon erik is in a classroom, watching as charles stands at the front of the room surrounded by eager children who hang on his every word. from the second erik enters he knows why charles has chosen this particular space to spend his time. all around erik are signs that these children are different, special- evident in blue skin and red eyes and incredible wings and horns and scales. even the children who seem 'ordinary' soon shown themselves to be anything but, after charles' gentle encouragement of course. some are shy at first, but charles sits with them and talks softly and listens to their responses, and slowly, gradually they reveal their mutations. erik is fascinated, but unsurprised, and he knows helping others is what charles is made for. no one pays charles to attend the school, to dedicate one afternoon a week to assisting with the education of this small class of mutants, but erik knows that it would never be about that for charles anyway. charles lives to help others, to assist disadvantaged individuals in particular, and the benefit gained through the smiling faces of the tiny mutants all around him is clearly reward enough. of course, not all the tiny mutants are interested in charles exclusively\\u2026 at first erik is content to stand quietly at one side of the room and watch the scene in front of him, feeling his heart clench at the sight of charles, wide-eyed and smiling, encouraging a young boy to levitate a nearby stack of books. charles' enthusiasm is infectious and he is never more beautiful than when he is embroiled in one of his areas of interest, and erik is simply lost for a while as he stares over at charles in wonder. but then there is a hand on erik's knee, tugging at his trouser leg, and erik drops his gaze to regard a small girl with large, brown eyes, who holds up a cookie to erik like a gift. when charles comes to erik later he is sat on the floor with the girl, watching in fascination as in front of him swirls of blue and purple light refract in the air. they are bursts of energy, capable of tearing down buildings or destroying lives, but here they are a toy, a game, and erik is comforted to realise that there may be a future for these children where they can use their powers freely without fear of reprisal, and not be seen as weapons by default. perhaps charles will be the one to make it so. perhaps erik will help him. erik is so engrossed he barely notices as charles approaches, not until there is a gentle hand carding through erik's hair, and erik looks up to find charles staring down at him with pure, unadulterated love and affection on his face. charles pushes erik's hair back from his forehead, smiles at him, and says softly thank you for coming with me. erik doesn't need the gratitude- this afternoon has been a gift not a chore- so he simply smiles back at charles and tells him you're welcome, mein geliebter . the journey back to the university is frustrating and overly long. there are train delays and overcrowding, and the situation is made worse by the stifling heat that arises in the late afternoon and envelopes the city in a dense smog. but erik doesn't mind. charles is happy, almost giddy, and when charles experiences such moods he usually expresses himself by being even more tactile than usual- something that erik has grown to adore. and so, charles stands next to erik as they wait for a train, hugging one of erik's arms close to his chest as he rests his head against erik's shoulder. erik leans back against the wall behind himself and coolly surveys the scene, and knows that people are watching, and finds curiously that he doesn't mind. charles is a treasure, something to be proud of, and if his behaviour displays to the world that he is erik's then erik is okay with it. there are a couple of times when charles leans heavily on erik, like he is close to falling, and erik can tell from the way charles' eyelids are lowering that he is tired. but as erik looks down at where charles head rests on his shoulder and asks are you alright, schatz ? charles simply tilts his face up at erik, his eyes a deep blue like a night sky full of pure white stars, and replies i've never been better. when they eventually manage to get a train erik secures a seat for himself and charles, wraps his arm around charles and pulls him close, allows charles to snuggle into his chest, and is completely unsurprised when charles falls asleep in less than a minute. the nap on the train seems to restore charles' energy levels somewhat, and though when they reach the university erik has to gently shake charles awake, by the time they are walking together across campus charles is buoyant and lively once more. he chatters happily about the mutants they just met, about the progress they are making, about how cute erik looked playing with the children- something erik glowers at even if his derision is somewhat forced. of course, when charles is in such a jubilant mood even erik's pretend scowling cannot dispel his enthusiasm, so charles only smiles wider and playfully pokes at erik's sides. erik tries to grasp charles' arms but charles only squirms free and pokes erik even more, and then they are both laughing despite erik's best attempts, until erik finally grasps charles' wrists and pulls him close so they are pressed against each other. charles gazes up at erik, the brilliant blue sky of that day reflected in his eyes, and erik is so, so close to kissing him before suddenly charles flashes erik a wicked grin and pulls out of his hold, and then he is clutching his bag close to himself and running across campus whilst shouting first one back gets the first blowjob! there are a group of students walking nearby and part of erik is embarrassed to think that they might have heard charles' outburst, but a bigger part of him is entertained by charles' levity, and keen to win the challenge\\u2026 and so, erik races after charles, and it isn't long before he has him. erik catches up to charles somewhere near the student lounge, and passes him so easily that it's almost laughable. erik suspects that perhaps charles is hampered by the sheer weight of the books in his bag whilst erik isn't quite as burdened, or perhaps it's the thought of charles on his knees with his cherry-red lips around erik's cock that prompts erik to race ahead. either way, erik reaches the dormitory perhaps twenty seconds before charles does and waits at the entrance, arms folded across his chest triumphantly as he waits for charles to catch up. when charles arrives his cheeks are tinged with colour and his hair is in even more disarray than usual, but his smile is almost as wide as erik's which suggests that charles isn't too put out about losing. nice of you to join me, erik calls light-heartedly as charles sidles up to him and gives erik the finger. in consolation erik takes charles' bag from him and hauls it over his shoulder, and slides his hand into charles' to hold it as they walk upstairs. when they enter erik's room the space is warm and humid thanks to both the weather that afternoon and the fact that the heat has risen from the floors below, but with a flick of erik's fingers a nearby electric fan is turned on and erik is stepping over to the window to open it up. he's barely finished pushing open the window though when he feels charles step up behind himself- charles' arms snaking around erik's waist and charles' face pressing against erik's back. hallo , erik chuckles, laying his hands against charles' arms and stroking his palms along the fine hairs on charles' forearms. everything okay? mm\\u2026 charles replies, rubbing his face between erik's shoulder blades. i'm just really happy you came to the school with me. erik smiles. i am too. those children are remarkable- it's amazing that you're helping them like that. you helped too, erik. i think they really liked having you there. well, i know they did. i did too\\u2026 with that, charles squeezes erik more tightly, rising up on his tiptoes to press his face into the back of erik's neck and whispering i love you. the words are said into erik's skin like charles is trying to imprint them there, like he is trying to mark erik with the sentiment- a clear impression of how charles feels etched into erik's skin like a tattoo. it's more than erik needs in terms of clarity- he already feels charles' devotion in every breath charles' takes- but being reminded of it on an almost daily basis is a gift nonetheless. du bedeutest mir alles\\u2026 erik says softly, using the lessons charles has taught him to press his affection into charles' mind like a kiss, one that charles clearly recognises as immediately he lets out a happy murmur- his breath warm against erik's neck as he begins to place kisses to erik's skin. you're getting really good\\u2026 charles responds, his mouth trailing along the taut line of erik's shoulder. plus, i really like feeling you inside me like that. it's kind of kinky\\u2026 is that so\\u2026 erik smirks, turning around to face charles and cupping charles' face in his hands. well, don't think that gets you out of me being inside you in the other way - we did have a deal, after all. ah, i suppose we did\\u2026 charles grins, his eyes wide and mischievous. well, i'm a man of my word if nothing else\\u2026 he adds, licking his lips and just starting to drop to his knees, before erik grips charles under the arms to stop him. clothes off first\\u2026 erik requests firmly, trying to look authoritative and unaffected rather than like someone completely besotted with lust. charles quirks an eyebrow in response but heeds erik's words, beginning to slowly unbutton his shirt as he stares into erik's eyes. of course, charles can't just perform the act without being a fucking tease about it, and he undoes his buttons slowly, torturously, flashing erik glimpses of creamy white skin adorned with a constellation of freckles as he gradually shrugs the garment off. when his chest is bared charles next turns his attention to his trousers, but doesn't just remove them quickly either. he draws his fingertips slowly over his belt buckle first, knowing that erik can feel the warmth of charles' hands against the metal, and smirking as erik lets out a barely-suppressed groan in response. something wrong, dear? charles asks, his sweet face the epitome of faux innocence as he draws his belt slowly through the clasp of the buckle before removing it completely. erik practically wants to growl in frustration, and drag charles over to the bed to hurry things along, but erik has learned that- when it comes to charles- the wait is always undeniably worth it, even if it means erik suffers from a low burn of arousal that makes his cock strain uncomfortably against the confines of his trousers. besides, within a moment the wait is over, and charles is letting his clothing fall to the floor to stand before erik with his hands clasped together in front of himself- dropping his gaze and appearing almost nervous, almost shy. it's remarkable to erik that, after so many encounters, after all the things charles has let erik do to him, he still has the capacity to be somewhat bashful- as if erik hasn't seen every inch of charles' skin before now, or mapped it out with his tongue. charles isn't even fully nude, but the sight is completely captivating nonetheless- particularly as erik can see the prominent line of charles' erection just visible behind his clasped hands, pushing up against the loose material of his boxer shorts. charles' underwear is new- erik can tell, he has seen every aspect of charles' wardrobe enough to recognise any changes, and besides- erik would know if he has seen this particular garment before\\u2026 erik laughs softly, reaching down to grasp both of charles' hands and gently tugging them apart. well, these are certainly interesting\\u2026 erik grins, hooking one finger into the front of charles' boxer shorts and running it along the hem, drawing it over the sensitive skin above charles' groin and causing charles to inhale a shaky breath in response. the boxer shorts charles is wearing are grey, and are adorned with a pattern of tiny red magnets and yellow lines presumably supposed to represent a magnetic pull. erik has become accustomed to the eccentricities of charles' wardrobe, which appears to be a mix of decidedly formal shirts, trousers, and cardigans, along with a number of t-shirts emblazoned with scientific slogans and several pairs of gaudy patterned socks, but until this point charles' underwear has always remained entirely neutral in colour and style. erik can only hazard a guess as to why charles has made any changes now. these are for me? erik asks, stepping closer and using his grip on the underwear to pull charles towards himself. everything i do is for you, charles replies with complete conviction, staring down and watching erik's hand as it touches him. do you like them? yes\\u2026 erik says with a smile, drawing his thumb across the point of charles' hip, where the red starburst of a fading bruise on charles' skin marks out the evidence of erik's earlier affections. liebling \\u2026 you're beautiful\\u2026 at that charles looks up, and the experience is like being hit by a thunderbolt. the sunlight glinting through the open window is reflected in charles' eyes, in the dazzling array of blue in his irises- like leagues of colour in the ocean, like water that can sustain life or drown people in its wake. charles smiles at erik seemingly in gratitude, almost like he is surprised at the words, and erik can understand why\\u2026 although erik may regard charles with such affection and devotion it sometimes makes it hard for him to breathe, he has never been very good at expressing himself. words of sentiment, when seldom spoken, are often concealed in erik's native language- reminding him of the last time he was able to speak so freely, when he did so to his mother. there is a wall around erik's heart, and though charles' careful influence has rendered the barrier as increasingly more like a trellis, the gaps in erik's defences can only let so much through. often erik wonders if it is enough, and if his own conservation will drive charles away in the end, but when charles looks at erik like this- with such love and pure faith in his eyes- erik can allow himself to hope for a time that everything will be okay. the moment passes without further comment, more said between their eyes and from their hearts than what can be expressed in words, and then charles is smiling somewhat impishly as he trails his hands down erik's forearms, using his grip on erik's hands to encourage erik to push the underwear down. charles' boxer shorts drop to the floor, and erik barely has time to look before charles is kicking the underwear away and kneeling down on the soft carpet at erik's feet. charles keeps his eyes locked with erik's as he settles down, knees parted, hands resting against the floor, cock hard and standing to attention between his legs. it's a completely bewitching sight, and the desire for erik to hastily wrench free of his clothing has never been more tangible. but this is no longer about what erik can take from charles it's about what he can give to him, and so erik mimics charles' slow seduction from before, and removes his clothing leisurely. on the floor, charles is patient. he watches erik devotedly, like there is no finer sight in the world than erik gradually peeling his t-shirt off and throwing it across the room, like there are untold secrets hidden in erik's trousers and he cannot wait to discover them. erik is having a moment of regret as he unbuttons his jeans, wishing he had taken the time to kiss charles before he settled down, that he had pressed his tongue into charles' eager mouth to taste charles' moans before pushing him to his knees, but it is too late for that now. and besides, when erik slides his trousers and underwear down in one smooth motion, the look on charles' face makes up for it. charles stares at the parts of erik now exposed and his hands immediately tremble like he aches to touch, but whatever desire charles is experiencing is kept in check as he once more looks back up to meet erik's eyes, waiting patiently. no hands, erik says quietly, edging his discarded clothing away with his feet before stepping closer, feeling the plush carpet tickle the space between his toes. charles' eyebrows raise in response, but there is a tell-tale smile in the corner of his mouth that says he likes this game, as he always does, and so he simply shifts a bit closer, and waits. erik cannot fight the urge to touch, so he slides one hand into charles' hair to hold him, to connect with him, and then he moves closer and angles his cock towards charles' waiting mouth. their eye-contact is unbroken as charles parts his lips, as erik feels charles' breath ghost across the head of his cock, as erik begins to push inside, feeling charles' mouth- warm and accommodating- start to surround him. erik uses his hold on charles' hair to guide him, watching transfixed as charles' perfect pink lips slide along the length of his shaft, groaning quietly as charles' clever tongue swirls around the head of his cock. erik can't help but buck his hips at that, and though it's hard to tell completely, erik is sure he can see the flicker of a smile in charles' bright eyes. after a short while erik lets go of his hold on charles' hair and stops rocking forward, watching instead as charles sucks gently on the head of his cock for a while before pushing forward to take the full length in his mouth again, always looking up at erik, always keeping his hands resting against the floor as instructed. erik can only tolerate a few moments of that before he has to touch charles again- stroking one hand through the soft locks of charles' hair as he leans forward to glance down at the smooth line of charles' back, at pale skin interspersed with an array of freckles leading down to the round curve of charles' buttocks. as erik admires the view charles pushes further, causing erik to groan as he feels his cock slip into the tight channel at the back of charles' throat, until charles gasps around the length and has to withdraw, and removes his mouth completely. when erik leans back to look at charles again his face is flushed and he is breathing hard, but he still looks at erik with such love it makes erik's heart ache with feeling in response. erik brushes charles' hair back from his forehead and yearns to kiss him, but charles is once again edging forward to take erik's cock in his mouth before erik can do anything, leaving erik lost to the feelings of pleasure once more as his member slides into wet heat. still, as erik gazes down at charles he smiles at him, murmurs you're amazing\\u2026, and there is a sensation erik can feel coming from charles' mind like a surge of warmth, and erik knows he is happy. as the encounter continues it is very much like a balancing act a reciprocal give-and-take that varies between erik fucking charles' mouth and charles sucking erik's cock, each action causing a hot, tight sensation to build up in the base of erik's member, causing his stomach muscles to flutter promisingly with each lingering thrust. the sensation is heightened by the moans coming from charles that erik feels vibrate through the length of his shaft, moans that are either as a result of charles feeling erik's pleasure rolling off of him in heady magenta waves, or simply because charles is just enjoying himself that much. when erik draws close he once more slides a hand into charles' hair, entwining his fingers in thick brown tendrils whilst using his other hand to grasp hold of his own cock, and starting to stroke. it doesn't take much- charles' mouth is still sucking gently at the head of erik's cock and making erik groan in response- and with charles continuing to look up at erik so devotedly erik feels the pleasure drawn from himself like charles is commanding it, like charles needs it as much as erik does. as erik's breath stutters in his throat charles finally moves his hands, resting one palm on erik's knee and squeezing lightly as erik comes into charles' mouth, watching as erik groans in his pleasure and his speech is lost to intermittent german curses. there is some time after erik has finished coming when charles still keeps his mouth on erik's cock, drawing his lips slowly along the shaft as erik's fingers fumble blindly in charles' hair in his hazy pleasure-state, until erik finally pulls back to let his cock slip out of charles' mouth and charles once more withdraws his hands. for a while erik continues to gaze down at charles, stroking his fingers slowly through charles' hair, thinking about how much he loves and needs this man who will drop to his knees without question, who will give erik everything he wants but can never ask for. it goes much further than the intimacy they've shared, than all the times charles has given his body to erik in wilful subjugation. as charles has already said, everything he does is for erik, and though part of erik cannot understand why charles is able to be so devoted to someone so unworthy, he is grateful for it nonetheless. charles remains sat on the floor looking up at erik, warm sunlight from the window casting a glow upon his face, illuminating every delicate freckle on his skin like fading embers in a fireplace. he is beautiful, and erik reaches down for him without question, slides his hands under charles' arms to pull him up, grasps charles' thighs once charles is upright and hauls the smaller man up- causing charles to let out a slight noise of surprise in response before he adjusts and wraps his legs firmly around erik's waist to hold on. erik carries charles over to the bed and lays down upon it, finding the sheets to be warm against his back courtesy of the rectangle of light that illuminates the bed complimented by the heat from charles' body against his front. it takes a bit of wriggling before erik is able to recline comfortably against the pillows, and then he lays there- still and sated- as charles hums happily and nuzzles his face into erik's neck, his hair brushing against erik's chin as he settles down. there is a low buzz of noise coming from the world outside- faint voices, a pulse of music playing, birds singing. erik registers none of it. his world is inside this room, in his bed, in his arms. nothing else matters. erik trails his fingertips slowly down the curve of charles' spine, smiling as charles lets out a tiny moan and snuggles nearer to erik, like close isn't close enough. erik can feel charles' cock, warm and hard in the tight space in-between their bodies, but charles makes no move to chase his own bliss. it's a marker of the selflessness charles exhibits during every encounter he shares with erik, like he is simply content to be with erik in whatever guise erik chooses, and he expects nothing in return. you're perfect\\u2026 erik murmurs, pressing his knuckles into the dimples above charles' ass. against the side of erik's neck charles lets out a small chuckle. you're only saying that because you've just had your cock in my mouth, he replies. no, charles- i'm saying it because you're extraordinary, erik counters, tilting his face towards charles and sliding one hand into his hair. charles turns his head at that, bathing erik in a bewitching bolt of blue as he gazes into erik's eyes. darling\\u2026 charles says softly, one hand tracing circles on erik's chest with his fingertips. thank you. you're perfect too. erik can't help but scoff in response, and though he immediately sees a flicker of discontent manifest in charles' expression he cannot bring himself to regret his reaction, not even when charles frowns and lifts his head from erik's shoulder, looking down at erik disapprovingly. i wouldn't say it if i didn't mean it, erik. you're perfect to me. there are wealth of reasons erik could offer up for why charles is wrong- all the parts erik can feel within himself like stains on his soul- but erik suspects charles already knows, even if he is too polite to ever mention it out loud. it's likely charles doesn't regard those aspects as imperfections anyway- he has a habit of seeing the good in everything, in everyone. it's one of the things erik loves about him most of all. you're perfect\\u2026 charles whispers, leaning close to place heartfelt kisses to erik's jawline, cheek, forehead- drawing soft lips across erik's skin as his hands move to cup erik's face. erik can feel charles' mind too, like soft light in his periphery, like the sunlight coming in through the open window, warming every part of erik that is cold and dark. erik is close to admitting defeat as he lies there holding charles' waist, but he still huffs quietly under his breath and says you can't say that- you haven't just had your cock in my mouth. of course, charles laughs, his breath warm against erik's temple where charles' mouth is currently pressed. oh, so is that the requirement for uttering that statement after all? charles smirks. well, if you'd like to rectify the situation i'm only too happy to accommodate you\\u2026 he adds, wriggling his hips so that erik feels charles' hard member press more firmly against his stomach. it's as good a way of keeping charles quiet as any, and so erik murmurs alright, and slides his hands down to cup charles' arse to encourage charles to sit up. charles does so, slowly, but once he is seated straddling erik's waist he looks down at erik and says sweetheart, i was joking . i wasn't, erik replies, squeezing charles' buttocks lightly. come here\\u2026 erik pulls charles gently but firmly towards himself, even as charles continues to ask erik if he is sure, until charles is kneeling just in front of erik's face and he grasps the windowsill behind the bed to steady himself. transferring his grip to hold charles' waist, erik pulls charles closer, but bypasses charles' straining erection and presses his mouth instead to the soft skin of charles' groin, causing charles to groan heatedly in response. charles' helpless moans continue for a while as erik trails his tongue over to the crease of charles' thigh, grazes his teeth gently over the point of charles' hip, until finally he withdraws and brings his mouth close to charles' cock at last, and brushes his lips against the sensitive head before opening up and taking charles in. as erik slides his mouth along charles' cock he looks up, seeing that charles' eyes are closed but knowing that his senses are wide open anyway. erik can feel the swell of charles' pleasure through more than just the thick length in his mouth, he can feel it coming from charles' mind like a warm summer breeze gliding through erik's perception continual waves of pleasure cresting across erik's mind as erik sucks earnestly on charles' cock. other than the occasional impassioned moan, charles is still and serene, and the only movement he makes is to reach down with one hand to gently push erik's hair back from his forehead. he looks down at erik and he is glorious- pale and lovely in the sunlight of the afternoon, like he is carved from fine marble, like he is a work of art. when charles comes he does so with a low murmur- his release something erik feels run through every part of himself like a pulse of electricity thanks to the power of charles' telepathy. charles' legs tremble as he shudders through his orgasm so erik uses his hands to hold charles steady, and keeps his mouth moving on charles' cock until charles shifts uncomfortably due to the increased sensitivity, and erik allows him to withdraw. charles moves like he is going to drop to the side to lay next to erik, but instead erik keeps hold of charles and pulls charles back down on top of himself once more, wrapping his arms around charles' back firmly and tilting his head to place a kiss to charles' forehead. there are a few blissful moments when charles lifts his face and kisses erik slowly, passionately, like there is nothing he would rather be doing with his afternoon, with his life, and then he settles down once more with his head resting against erik's chest. you're perfect\\u2026 charles murmurs quietly. for once, erik doesn't argue with him.\",\n          \" kel 25 had a sky the color of charcoal and dirt a few shades darker connie could only tell sky from earth by tracing the high black mounds in the distance, which stood out against the horizon like silhouettes of hulking giants. against the pitch were gleaming white towers, hints of other colors shining like opals in muck. connie looked for the three nested towers of what pearl called the temple of heaven and earth and started walking. the robonoids followed her. her mission was simple retrieve the poofed and damaged gems that had been trapped in the collapsed towers if she could, scout the area if she couldn't, and determine what had caused every gem in the area to suddenly lose contact with homeworld three hundred years ago. connie knew that steven would have preferred to come with her, and that she would have been smarter to wait, but she really hadn't wanted to. it was only a little mission, and there were no documented predators or even multicellular organisms on this planet. if she was injured or got sick, one of the robonoids would sent out a distress message. there wasn't any real danger. plus, she thought as her communicator activated in her ear with a little ding, it wasn't like she was out of range. ... connie? how are you doing so far? is there any sign of hostilities? nothing yet, pearl, connie said, climbing up a few boulders and sliding down the other side with a thump. her boots threw up little puffs of dirt. just a whole lot of atmosphere. this place is really fascinating! it was. gems had surveyed it three centuries ago and had found a wealth of minerals below the surface. they had touched down in their aesthetically-designed ships in all their multitudes, had built temples and towers and had started terraforming- and then it had stopped all at once, every preliminary colonist cutting off contact without warning, and since no one important had been lost, the diamonds had written them off. now, since gems were supposed to have individual worth as sapient beings, the diamonds were finally sending out a search party. three centuries late. maybe that wasn't too long for gems- connie remembered no tv for one thousand years , thank you very much- but it was still discouraging. i suppose it is, came pearl's reluctant response, but you can never be too careful. remember, this is a scouting mission. if you encounter any dangerous situations, you are not to engage. understood, ma'am. connie walked for another hour, digging out a protein bar for quick calories and ducking into shadowed alcoves at any sign of a glint. she found a smashed piece of what looked like a communicator, an intact gem destabilizer, and something that could have been a gem shard but turned out to be a rock. eventually she passed under hulking abandoned injectors, thick bacteriophage drilled into the ground with empty tanks, but there were no holes around them where new gems had been born kel 25, for one reason or another, hadn't birthed any of the new diopsides or jades that it had been annexed to provide. the injectors cast deep shadows over the black soil as the distant twin suns dropped under the horizon, one lagging behind the other like a nervous child. connie checked her rations, figured they were acceptable, and called the robonoids closer so one of them could provide some light. the rest of them continued to range out around her, scanning the ground for shards. the red light didn't damage her night vision, which was why it was so useful it did bathe the alien landscape the color of warm blood, only illuminating the ground a few feet around her before the light faded into red-tinged shadows. connie kept her eyes on the ground, careful not to step in any holes or trip over an unfortunate rock. she'd already tripped once, scraping her elbow, and she wasn't interested in doing it again. only another hour to the temple. she would have transported there directly, but the closest working warp pad had been out in the wastes, and pearl had thought there might be gems who had fled to it before the colony's collapse. kel 25 had an incredibly dense core for its size, which gave it about the gravity of mars, but its days lasted about three hours each. connie had never had a chance of completing the whole expedition in daylight. she wouldn't have had a chance to go on the expedition at all, except that there was a breathable atmosphere and something had already happened to the gems in residence. the hope had been that an organic could scout out the location without being detected immediately as a gem might. connie had mostly jumped on the chance because she'd been stir-crazy it was spring break back home, and she hadn't been to space in ages . the temple came into view, opaline towers gleaming dully in the beams of the robonoids, and immediately one of them froze like a pointing dog, laser fixed on a shining spot on the ground. connie hurried over and plucked the gem up in her hands, then jerked back in disgust and dropped it. sorry, she said awkwardly, even though the gem probably couldn't hear her. she shook the black goop off her palms, grimacing at the sticky thickness of it, and scraped the rest off on a convenient rock, into the earth then, pulling on gloves, she picked up the gem again and scratched the rest of the gunk off. it was a peridot, completely undamaged but covered in dust. she'd never reformed. that didn't bode well. pearl? connie asked, knowing the comm would activate at her name, i found my first gem. she's a peridot, and i don't see any damage, but her gem was covered in this weird black goo. i think it might be keeping her from coming back. she waited for a response, but none was forthcoming. pearl? are you there? connie felt goosebumps rise on her arms. spread out, she said, and the robonoids fanned out around her, illuminating the area. nothing moving but them, no changes close to them but her communicator wasn't working anymore. connie pulled off one of her gloves and reached up to tug it out of her ear, frowned when she noticed the speck of black on its shimmery casing. she hadn't touched it before just then, so where...? she touched the black speck, and it stuck to her finger easily enough, but the comm remained dull. and here she'd thought pearl had only been distracted for a while. stupid . how long had she been out of contact? more importantly, what was this black stuff? she stuffed the peridot's gem in her bag, deciding not to use any more gem tech if she could help it, and came to a decision, feeling remarkably clear-headed. the goop wasn't hurting her, and as long as she didn't get it on the warp pad it should still work, shouldn't it? but every moment these gems spent down here could mean they were deactivated permanently, if they weren't already, and nothing had actually harmed her yet. plus, the more she brought back to the ships, the more chance homeworld's scientists would be able to reverse whatever had happened to these gems. she just had to do her job and scout, like she was supposed to. the temple's entrance was crumbled in on itself, the bridge that led to the rest of it cut off halfway and almost definitely unstable. connie spied a higher level, half-open to the air, and shot her grappling hook to catch in one of the grooves. she tugged- it held- and buckled herself into her climbing harness, making her careful way up the crumbling mosaic of blue diamond. the robonoids followed her closely, but kept to her orders not to touch the walls. she didn't want to risk losing them, too. the second floor yielded more gems, stuck to the floor or walls, alone or in clusters of two or three. connie pried them loose carefully, keeping track- ruby, ruby, lapis lazuli, some kind of quartz- as she placed them in her bag. one of them she tried to pull loose and pulled in half instead, the black goop the only thing keeping it together connie swallowed at that, distant sorrow hitting her like a wave, and packed the two halves carefully, just in case. there weren't any other signs of struggle in the hallways- no scuffs on the walls, no holes in the floor, no broken weapons or shattered pieces. only lights that wouldn't come on, and doors that had to be pried open with a crowbar, and that black dust collecting thick and tarry on every surface. connie dug out her own head lamp, deciding on certainty over retained night vision, and lit her way forward as brightly as she could. it didn't help her unease as much as she'd hoped it would. i don't know if you can hear me, pearl, because i definitely can't hear you, connie said, voice barely a whisper in the empty rooms. it still echoed like a gunshot, deeper into the earth. but you shouldn't send any gems down here. something is seriously wrong. farther in. she started to find hints of life, signs that gems had existed here once a few scraps of someone's pet tech project, gem script scratched into a wall in what looked a lot like graffiti, a chamber full of weapons strewn about like someone had interrupted a sparring match. there was an observation orb lying dead on the ground in one chamber, and a whole line of buttons and screens coated black in another. some parts had script that didn't seem like gem, too, or bits of technology that weren't familiar at all, but connie ignored those she had a mission to complete. she found a sapphire, two other blue gems she couldn't identify, and something she thought was a kind of rutile. her bag grew full, but she kept finding them, so she kept stuffing them in, wincing when they clinked against each other. there were three hundred gems here, at least. she'd never been meant to actually collect this many. she was a scout. going into the earth. she climbed up to the third floor of the temple, forcing open the entrance to the first tower, and had squeezed entirely through before she realized that the only light she had was white. robonoids? no response. she peered back through the slim entrance she'd managed to create, but no red floating orbs were in sight. they must have touched the walls at some point. she breached the next inner sanctum, gazing wide-eyed at the delicate inlays of the ceiling, iridescent white and blue like mermaid's scales there was only one gem in this room- a pearl- and connie had to scrabble with her fingers for twenty minutes to pry it loose. in the inside of the tower, ceiling so high above it was like looking at the sky, she could see more clearly how the blackness had spread it only ebbed into color at over twenty feet in the air, watermarking the walls like flood gauges. connie stared at it, transfixed, then reached up to her comm- except it wasn't in her ear. not on the floor, either, and not outside in the hallway. pearl? she asked aloud, confused, but the comm didn't spark to life. because... it had been disabled, like the robonoids. disabled, and yet she'd kept going deeper into the temple without even marking her way, with only one light and no food and no way out and this hadn't even been her mission - why was she here? she should have turned back as soon as her comm stopped working. she should have reported that something was wrong, taken the first gem she'd found back with her and come back with reinforcements, let homeworld's scientists look over the samples she'd taken so far. she shouldn't have gone deeper in, alone, without giving her friends any way to track her or know what she was doing. something was incredibly wrong. something was... affecting her, maybe, making her think in ways she'd been trained out of. for what purpose? what reason - a glint in the corner of the room. connie moved toward it by rote, but it wasn't a gem it was a little doll with a shard of rock sewn into its chest, with too many arms and a face that wasn't human, wasn't really humanoid at all. connie held it blankly, unable to make her mind work, before something in her screamed pay attention! and she realized that her hand looked wrong. her veins were black . she swallowed back panic and rolled up her sleeve to see the black streaks cutting through her skin all the way up to her elbow, which was stained pitch like she'd dipped it in ink the dark stripes continued to her shoulder and radiated onto her collarbone, the back of her neck, above her breasts. she pressed on the dark parts, but didn't feel pain whatever it was doing to her, discomfort was not a part of it. connie took a deep breath, forced herself to sit down and cross her legs. no more movement until she knew what was going on. that was final . an alien doll. a black gunk that killed gem tech as soon as it touched it. an infection that made her move deeper into the temple and forget what she was supposed to be doing. what did those have in common? what did they mean? unfamiliar script and technology meant... someone else had been there? for long enough that they would have made toys with gem shards and marked up the walls. they had been there, but they weren't there now. possibly the same thing had happened to them as had happened to the homeworld terraformers- as was happening to connie. she needed to get back to the warp pad. connie got to her feet, stuffing the doll in her bag for safekeeping, and stepped back out of the exit. her mind blanked when she stared down both sides of the hallway, but she gritted her teeth and chose a direction, scratching a long line across the wall with the remnants of a gem destabilizer. the temple wasn't that big. she could get out, and if she couldn't she could last a few more hours and follow sunlight to an exit. whatever was happening, it wasn't going to get her. urgency forced her out of the tower, towards the outer parts of the temple, but the hallways all blurred together. had she gone left or right, at that junction? had she been at that junction at all? more discrepancies jumped out at her rotted food beneath the black mold, sketched-out drawings of creatures she'd never seen before, a knife with unfamiliar stylings at the hilt. she kept picking them up to put in her bag before realizing that they weren't gems and didn't need to be taken with her. it took her longer to notice that the reason she couldn't put anything in her bag was because she'd dropped it, somewhere between the inner sanctum and the first tower, and when she did notice it sent a cold trickle of fear down her back. so. she couldn't trust her own perceptions at all, then. what could she do? she took the gem destabilizer- she still had that, at least- and scraped out a message on the walls, as legible as she could make it don't touch. it changes your mind. did that make sens e? did that make any sense at all? would it matter if aliens saw it, since they might not translate? maybe all those inscriptions she'd seen hadn't been graffiti but similar warnings, made useless by language barriers. connie wished she wasn't too hyped on adrenaline and nerves to be fascinated by what could be an alien rosetta stone. she finished the message and stepped back, turning to the exit- except she didn't know where the exit was. she didn't- but there was an exit. but she had a mission? no, the mission was to- to scout , to get out, to go deeper into the temple and into the earth . i'm not doing that, connie said to no one, but she found herself following a path anyway, stepping past discarded gems and organic scraps. connie trailed the gem destabilizer across the wall whenever she thought of it, but mostly she followed the path. her feet were made for the path, or must have been, because it had been followed before. she could see prints in the black beneath her boots. her hand caught at one of the doorways, gripping white-knuckled, and she took advantage of the momentary confusion to wrench herself back and sink to the floor, bury her head in her knees. stay still , she told herself. stay still. when you get lost you have to stay still until someone finds you, you (deeper into the earth) have to wait for rescue. something's in my head, ma'am, she said aloud, because she thought she should. i'm compromised. can you find me? somehow she was standing again, and then she was moving. her feet hurt, but her pace didn't slow. the headlamp flickered off, finally running out of battery. she didn't know if that meant it was daylight. it didn't matter. she had a path. (into the earth) she had a path and she would follow it, if her feet would stop stumbling, if her hands would stop catching at things, if her knees would stop crumbling when they didn't even hurt. again she was kneeling, scratching something into the black gunk st st st st over and over again, not even a full word. stop? stay? stretch? steven, she tried, but it didn't make sense why she'd be writing his name anywhere. he wasn't coming with her into the earth. he was- in space, in orbit, at home. on the other planet. not this planet but a different, vaster one, a stranger one with lighter soils. the walls lost their gem-patterns and became dark and musty, close to her shoulders so she had to turn sideways to get through the passages. there must have been light coming from somewhere she could make out shapes in the dark, and she didn't trip even once. the sides of the tunnels expanded and contracted under her fingers when she pressed against them. they were warmer than her hands. into the earth for hours and hours, until her stomach felt tight, until her feet cracked and bled, until her ankles blistered against her socks and her legs ached, following the path laid out for her. somewhere she dropped the gem destabilizer, too, but she didn't mind it was less weight to carry. finally the walls were more red than black, bathed crimson by a warm, beckoning light connie stepped out into an open chamber, a cavern so wide that its ceiling was like a stalactite-laden sky, and stared in wondering horror. once, connie had seen the crystal heart that powered the temple back in beach city, bright pink and glassy this heart was a deeper red, so vast it stretched from one horizon of the cavern to another, broader than all of beach city combined. gleaming bitter red, glowing with blood-warmth and pulsing, humming through her flesh until she felt loose like wet meat, flushed all in black and blood. others were there, too, strange beings with too many arms and carapaces, creeping along the walls or skittering on the floor. connie couldn't move, could only stare with blown-wide pupils at the massive beating heart, the lovely sanguine center of the planet, could only absorb the sight of it. her thoughts ebbed and flowed, jumbling into each other until some inner levy broke and sloshed them loose then she crumbled to her knees, suddenly light-headed, and said, wait. i don't- this isn't my planet. it was, though, came the thought. it was her planet. her tunnels, her beating heart to serve. it thrummed through her like her own pulse, drove her blood to warm her. connie shuddered, hugging herself, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it was right, that it had- those gems, she tried again, but the thought had already left her. determination made her press on, made her gather them back to her like scraps of paper. she would say what she meant to say. those gems, you- hurt them. you're the planet. you hurt these people. some of the aliens came closer to her, catching her by the arms and pulling her back into a side of the cavern, into an alcove in the wall, into the earth. they herded her into the dirt and she kicked, bit at them, lizard-brain terror catching where coherence couldn't reach. but there were so many of them. so many, blank and empty-eyed, rotten black and sloughing skin into the dirt to feed the earth. they pushed her in and moved close, pulling strands from their bodies and wrapping her, binding her as the heart pulsed through her mind and made her limp and unresisting. they cocooned her away from the light. connie's hands were trapped against her chest, fingers brushing the heavy strands as they smothered her she pushed against them just a little, curious, but couldn't press past that. into the earth. into the planet. this wasn't something she should fight. the heart beat through her in a lazy percussion, expanding and contracting scarlet on the insides of her eyelids when she blinked. she closed her eyes without meaning to and breathed slowly, in and out like she was meditating, until her mind drifted away. the heartbeat drove her blood to warm her. * silence. * connie opened her eyes with a gasp, wriggling in her bonds, and immediately tried to scream. her body didn't respond to her commands, though, only moved like it had a mind of its own, and fear suffused her like cold water. she'd- been stupid, cut herself and not noticed , gotten mind-controlled and now it was too late - the cocoon was dark and suffocating, red light bleeding through the fibers and making her skin glow dark, making the streaks in her veins stand out. the heartbeat pounded through her skull, disturbing now instead of comforting she tried to block it out, humming in her mind, but it bashed through her thoughts like they didn't exist, made her brain feel like it was welling up with blood. all crimson, behind her eyes, all saying go to sleep, leave it be, sink into the earth but she couldn't, she wouldn't, if she did she would cease to exist . she threw every part of her will at her body, lashing out for control of one eyelid, one finger, one muscle fiber. it was as useless as fighting an ocean. before, when the heart had been leading her, she'd been able to subvert it now it was like it had taken her brain and left her severed from every nerve ending, a vestigial organ just waiting to be culled. like being a puppet. but she couldn't be, she didn't want to die, she had so much to do still- connie tried to scream again, tried to cry, tried to thrash and escape but her body wasn't hers anymore, was just moving on its own like an automaton - hold on, her voice rasped, sounding surprised, and she froze. that tone of voice- was that-? am i connie? relief surged through her, and she collapsed back into the background, desperately grateful. not the heart. not a mindless puppet for an alien planet, not a meatsuit for breaking gems and killing shipwrecked aliens. her body was in safe hands. in steven's hands. her best friend didn't seem to know what to do with himself at first he used her fingers to press against the skin of the cocoon, blinking slowly, then forced through the fibers with her shoulder. the push made him stumble painfully into the ground, and he righted himself immediately, staring at her black-streaked hands. they were shaking . what's going on? i'm being mind-controlled by the planet, connie tried to say, but steven only turned to look around the cramped tunnel, obviously confused. he couldn't hear her, connie realized with a start. he couldn't hear her at all . but then how would he know where to go, where to pick up the injured gems? steven! steven, i'm right here, you have to listen to me! nothing. connie despaired as he stared at her surroundings, feeling her eyes go wide with horror. have you been trapped here all this time? connie, i'm so sorry, i- i should have come sooner- he cut off, tears pricking at her eyes, but connie's mind was blank. what? how long has it been? steven? her body continued to move without her permission, steven wincing at her bloodied feet and staggering with one hand to the wall. the tunnel they'd herded her into was so tight that it scraped against both her shoulders, constricting her chest when she inched sideways, and connie was ninety percent sure that it had deepened after they'd cocooned her in. she felt steven shudder at the claustrophobic fit. crimson light glowed at the entrance to the larger chamber, filling the doorway with red like a giant eye steven faltered, shrinking back, but squared her shoulders. he knew as well as connie did that there wasn't another way out. he stepped into the beating heart's chamber and froze up completely, pulse going rapid. connie winced back from the thrum of influence that pulsed through her, marshaling her thoughts together as her only defense steven, still taking in the chamber, saw the carapace-aliens and shrank back into the tunnel. that's not good, he whispered. were they kidnapped, too? if you'd actually hear me i could help you, connie couldn't help thinking, nervous and snappy with it, but of course it didn't reach him. steven hid in the tunnel until one of the aliens stepped into it and stopped at the sight of him, then said tentatively, hi. i'm steven. can you, uh- can you understand me? the alien regarded him blankly, head lolling and eyes rotten black out of its head, thorax falling apart like an ant possessed by fungi. black sludge dripped off it and plopped onto the floor one of its many arms hung limp and snapped-off at its side. too far gone for thought, connie figured, and felt steven mirror the conclusion. his arm rose up defensively in front of him as the alien approached, then faltered when no shield appeared. she could feel the realization steal over him no powers, no familiarity with the body, only whatever connie had left in her after being held captive for what had apparently been more than a day. steven, you have to listen to me! you don't know the way out! can you hear me? he pressed anyway. are you still alive in there? he reached out- steven, what- and touched the zombie alien's side, making a face at the sludge coating connie's hand. the alien paused, body stiffening- connie felt a burst of incredulity- then flew into motion, grabbing connie's wrist and slamming her against the wall. steven yelped in her voice and kicked out at it, wriggling loose and ducking beneath its claws, but her body was weak. other aliens wrestled it onto its knees. they held her arms behind her back and forced them- forced steven - to look into the beating heart. it was blood and warmth and vitality so intense it hurt to witness was glowing brighter than a star, washing the world crimson like a moonset, feeding its life into the dirt and the rock and its trillions of spores. its arteries reached into the core of the planet, its capillaries fine and fast beneath its crust, its lungs molten in the mantle of the world. in the high chamber it was the world, so large it reminded connie of steven's description of the cluster, and its veins reached over connie's head like massive tree trunks sunk deep into the earth. deeper into the earth. she was- this was her planet, she belonged to it- she felt her fists clench. you can't have her, steven growled with her voice. she doesn't belong to you. none of these people do! something thrummed, pulsed, throbbed through her flesh and pulled it apart like cooked muscle, loose and stringy connie felt nauseous and transfixed, overwhelmed, but steven only said heatedly, she doesn't belong to anyone. the hive-aliens crept closer, stained with black goop and dripping it. i need you to let her go, okay? i know it must have hurt when homeworld started drilling into you, but connie didn't have anything to do with that. she's just here on a rescue mission. it doesn't care, connie tried to say, but the words wouldn't come. steven, what are you doing? the heart reached into her head and twisted, dragging a scream out of her that never left her lips. connie lashed out at it, trying to make her thoughts a sword, but it batted her aside like she was nothing, smothered her thoughts until she couldn't breathe. what are you- stop that! steven sounded panicked. could he feel it, could he feel her? could he hear her? the heart pulsed brighter in retaliation for his command, searing out every thought in connie's head even as she spat and cursed at it, threw all she had into resisting, but it wasn't enough and the agony was blinding, steven steven please- i said stop it! steven screamed in connie's voice, and the red light snapped back and dimmed like it had been struck. connie felt strange, like there was something overlapping with her body, something new coursing through her like fresh energy- and then the sensation disappeared, feet moving rapidly beneath her, and she realized that steven was running. running the wrong way. connie tried to lurch her feet in the right direction, jerk a hand, anything, but her body wasn't her own steven had taken it over completely. she settled for yelling at him, trying to get him to hear something, but she was too late. her body ran up to a dead end, panting and shaking, and she felt her face fall. steven whirled around, but the aliens were already blocking the exit, clustered against the light. we can still fight! she yelled, but he was already shrinking back, hesitance making him slow. he could heal anything. if he could just get her body to the surface he could resurrect her, anything would be better than being an eternal mind-slave to a sociopathic planet, seriously , steven! one of the aliens jerked closer on rickety legs, and steven dove under it, rolling onto his feet and dashing down another hallway. he bounced off the breathing walls in his haste, shuddering at their warmth, and took passages wildly, darting back and forth like he was under a spell. connie didn't understand until steven muttered, come on, garnet, doubling back and narrowly dodging more of the hive-aliens, and then she realized it was future vision. she hadn't known he could carry that over into another body. her feet were bleeding worse now, but there was no time to stop steven sprinted into gem-made tunnels at last, taking turns like he'd lived in the temple all his life, and tripped over her bag, slamming hard into the ground. he scrambled upright immediately, tense like he was about to keep running, but stopped and stared at the bag for a second before grabbing it and slinging it over her shoulder. connie sighed in internal relief. finally her body wouldn't move any farther, muscles shaky and unable to hold her weight, and steven wedged her into a small alcove at the temple's edge and hid, ears straining for any sign of pursuit. it took a while for connie to push past her exhaustion to notice he was speaking. no- he was crying, tears streaming down her cheeks and leaving trails in black dust. please don't be too late, he was whispering, hugging her knees. i'm sorry i didn't notice, i'm sorry, please don't be too late, you'll be okay, i know you will- and connie hadn't thought about how it must seem, that he'd taken over her body when he must have only wanted to contact her, but now it was all too obvious. i'm fine, i'm right here, we're almost out, she tried to push at him, but he didn't hear her. he just kept weeping, quiet and terrified, completely unaware of her presence. i'm gonna get you out of here, he promised, we have a plan, okay, we just need to get to the cliff and we can get out, take all these gems with us, you just have to be alive in there, okay? don't be a zombie. it's hard to be jam buds with a zombie. believe me, steven, i'm trying my best. eventually she heard scuffling below them steven heard it too, scrambling to her feet just as a horde of aliens erupted from the dirt, and then they were running even as connie felt like she was about to collapse. the aliens were fast, wherever they'd been from. they moved like spiders or scorpions, skittering in quick tiny steps, and connie's exhausted body wasn't quick enough to outrun them. in her mind the heart pulsed come back come back come back, but she didn't have to listen, didn't even have to resist listening her body wasn't in either of their control. the aliens chased them to the west of the temple, away from the warp pad and to the jagged hills connie was only starting to remember the maps she'd reviewed when steven crested a hill and she realized they were heading straight toward a cliff. was this what you were talking about? steven? her friend froze, staggering like he saw something else, then- stumbled, faltered- connie leaped to her feet, adrenaline coursing through her veins, and whirled to see a horde of aliens encroaching. her brain felt empty and strange, echoey, and she couldn't find any trace of steven anywhere. steven? she shouted through her rasping throat. steven, are you there? what am i supposed to do from here? did you see something else? future vision could have told him this would kill her, or that his body was under attack, or any number of things. what had made him leave so suddenly? what had he seen, what was he planning to do? was the cliff still part of the plan? it didn't matter either way connie was cornered, and she'd never been clued in in the first place. she backed up as the horde approached, snarling and lashing out at reaching appendages, and thought, come on, garnet. thought he was heading toward the cliff, he was running full tilt and stopped suddenly, if i'm caught i'm dead anyway and steven won't let me die- the cliff. the cliff was the plan, and steven hadn't been planning to stop, and anyway she was out of options. if she died, they could retrieve her body and resurrect her if she broke every bone in her body, steven could heal her. the only unacceptable option was being enslaved by the beating heart, and she already knew steven could pull her out if that happened. it was like one of the trust falls that their gym teachers made them do in school close your eyes, spread your arms, lean back. let gravity take you. if you were lucky- if the other person was strong enough, was paying attention- they would catch you. was steven strong enough? was he paying attention? connie already knew the answer to both was yes . you should have asked nicely, she rasped at the encroaching horde, daring to smirk, and stepped backwards into open air.\"\n        ],\n

once the line connect what do you need to ask me today \",\n          \"after know charles for so many month erik be sure he know everything there be to know about him erik know charles be smart he know charles be kind he know that charles be a remarkably powerful mutant that he enjoy tea that he play rugby that he sometimes laugh in his sleep he know that charles rib be ticklish that there be a small birthmark on the top of charles right buttock in the shape of a tiny heart that charles toe cramp when he come erik know charles love him but what erik doesnt know be where charles go every wednesday afternoon at first erik doesnt even realise that charles absence on those day be tell it have take such a long time for the two of them to reach a place where they be in an actual commit relationship and previously their encounter be so unregimented and sporadic that erik never really notice that none of those meeting take place on a wednesday between pm and pm but then erik realise erik be in the library with charles that day write up some note from the lecture he have in the morning at the university charles and erik both attend there be no class on wednesday afternoon mean most student spend their free time study or relax or drink it be a beautiful sunny day and erik be consider go for a walk with charles or perhaps drive him to the seclude hillside spot that have become their special place or maybe take charles back to his dorm room so he can spend some time in bed with charles lay out beneath him but before erik can get out the word to vocalise any of the option charles be stand up from the table shove his book into his bag and announce his plan to leave youre go erik ask shoot charles a curious glance mm oh yes- sorry darling i have somewhere i need to be you have somewhere you need to be last wednesday\\u2026 erik reply think of the previous week when hed invite charles to join himself and the brotherhood on an out to the cinema before charles have decline the offer there be an immediate pang of jealous in eriks chest splinter into his heart with echo of it happen you know this couldnt last he find someone good you dont deserve him\\u2026 for some time erik have know that charles be not his equal that charles be bright smart kind than erik could ever hope to be- that his word and action make him worthy that he deserve more than erik can provide in that moment part of erik want to say nothing else want to allow charles to leave and simply go home alone to dwell in silence and solitude but charles have make erik promise long ago that erik would not hide and though it be difficult though erik want to protect himself from everything that could expose his vulnerability he be try to be better- for charles be you keep something from me\\u2026 erik ask get out that much but leave off the end of the sentence that say if you be i dont really want to know because if you leave me youll destroy me charles pause look at erik a he tuck an unruly lock of hair behind his ear charles hair be too long again- a chaotic brown mop atop his head- but erik like it he like the way charles hair fall against his chest when charles fall asleep in his arm and the way charles hair brush against the inside of his thigh when charles kiss him there not keep something from you no\\u2026 charles reply cautiously where i go be not a secret i just havent mention it because i wasnt aware you want to know why wouldnt i want to know no reason\\u2026 erik look- although i may think about you all the time i dont always take care to plot your reaction to certain thing or to assume what you do or dont want please dont interpret my failure to disclose this particular piece of information a some sort of attempt to deceive you i would never lie to you darling or keep anything from you but this be the first time youve ask me where im go so it didnt seem necessary to mention it until now alright\\u2026 erik say eventually feel the tight knot of dread in his chest begin to dissipate at charles reassure word so where be you go charles smile at that pick up the last of his book in one arm and extend the other hand towards erik before waggle his finger in invitation come and see half an hour late erik be sit next to charles in a train that carry them across the city normally erik doesnt particularly enjoy public transport prefer the convenience of his car above all else but there be something comfort about be enclose by metal all around feel the wheel of the train glide easily along the track a it take them to their destination next to erik charles be scribble note into a notepad- word and number and symbol spill out across the page like extract of charles mind express in untidy black ink erik will never cease to be amaze at the speed of charles brain at the ease of his thought at the way he can make connection with a single step that others cannot reach in a giant leap he be brilliant whats even more remarkable be the fact that he be eriks a erik watch charles he lean over slide one arm into the space between charles back and the upholster seat of the train and slip his thumb under charles shirt to gently draw circle against the skin of charles spine charles murmur in response pause his work to turn and look at erik and smile affectionately use his telepathy charles press a soft kiss against eriks mind and the warmth of the gesture remain evident all the way through the rest of the journey sometime late erik be stand next to charles a they both look up at a large build in the warm air there be the sound of police siren nearby and the low rumble of music play punctuate by the occasional enthusiastic shout across the street from where they stand the neighbour block of flat have numerous break window and there be a car up on block in front of the build and erik suddenly understand why charles would not let him drive of all the place erik might have imagine charles might be spend his wednesday afternoon erik never picture this simply from the way charles speak it be clear he have an air of class about him and from what charles have disclose about his childhood erik know he originally come from money even if he be no long a wealthy a he once be know that information erik cant help but be surprise that charles have be evidently spend his free time in a clearly disadvantage neighbourhood the only question be why then erik see the sign that display the building mean of business and he understand for the rest of the afternoon erik be in a classroom watch a charles stand at the front of the room surround by eager child who hang on his every word from the second erik enter he know why charles have choose this particular space to spend his time all around erik be sign that these child be different special- evident in blue skin and red eye and incredible wing and horn and scale even the child who seem ordinary soon show themselves to be anything but after charles gentle encouragement of course some be shy at first but charles sit with them and talk softly and listen to their response and slowly gradually they reveal their mutation erik be fascinate but unsurprised and he know help others be what charles be make for no one pay charles to attend the school to dedicate one afternoon a week to assist with the education of this small class of mutant but erik know that it would never be about that for charles anyway charles live to help others to assist disadvantage individual in particular and the benefit gain through the smile face of the tiny mutant all around him be clearly reward enough of course not all the tiny mutant be interest in charles exclusively\\u2026 at first erik be content to stand quietly at one side of the room and watch the scene in front of him feel his heart clench at the sight of charles wide-eyed and smile encourage a young boy to levitate a nearby stack of book charles enthusiasm be infectious and he be never more beautiful than when he be embroil in one of his area of interest and erik be simply lose for a while a he star over at charles in wonder but then there be a hand on eriks knee tug at his trouser leg and erik drop his gaze to regard a small girl with large brown eye who hold up a cookie to erik like a gift when charles come to erik late he be sit on the floor with the girl watch in fascination a in front of him swirl of blue and purple light refract in the air they be burst of energy capable of tear down building or destroy live but here they be a toy a game and erik be comfort to realise that there may be a future for these child where they can use their power freely without fear of reprisal and not be see a weapon by default perhaps charles will be the one to make it so perhaps erik will help him erik be so engross he barely notice a charles approach not until there be a gentle hand card through eriks hair and erik look up to find charles star down at him with pure unadulterated love and affection on his face charles push eriks hair back from his forehead smile at him and say softly thank you for come with me erik doesnt need the gratitude- this afternoon have be a gift not a chore- so he simply smile back at charles and tell him youre welcome mein geliebter the journey back to the university be frustrate and overly long there be train delay and overcrowd and the situation be make bad by the stifle heat that arise in the late afternoon and envelop the city in a dense smog but erik doesnt mind charles be happy almost giddy and when charles experience such mood he usually express himself by be even more tactile than usual- something that erik have grow to adore and so charles stand next to erik a they wait for a train hug one of eriks arm close to his chest a he rest his head against eriks shoulder erik lean back against the wall behind himself and coolly survey the scene and know that people be watch and find curiously that he doesnt mind charles be a treasure something to be proud of and if his behaviour display to the world that he be eriks then erik be okay with it there be a couple of time when charles lean heavily on erik like he be close to fall and erik can tell from the way charles eyelid be low that he be tire but a erik look down at where charles head rest on his shoulder and ask be you alright schatz charles simply tilt his face up at erik his eye a deep blue like a night sky full of pure white star and reply ive never be good when they eventually manage to get a train erik secure a seat for himself and charles wrap his arm around charles and pull him close allow charles to snuggle into his chest and be completely unsurprised when charles fall asleep in less than a minute the nap on the train seem to restore charles energy level somewhat and though when they reach the university erik have to gently shake charles awake by the time they be walk together across campus charles be buoyant and lively once more he chatter happily about the mutant they just meet about the progress they be make about how cute erik look play with the children- something erik glower at even if his derision be somewhat force of course when charles be in such a jubilant mood even eriks pretend scowl cannot dispel his enthusiasm so charles only smile wide and playfully poke at eriks side erik try to grasp charles arm but charles only squirm free and poke erik even more and then they be both laugh despite eriks best attempt until erik finally grasp charles wrist and pull him close so they be press against each other charles gaze up at erik the brilliant blue sky of that day reflect in his eye and erik be so so close to kiss him before suddenly charles flash erik a wicked grin and pull out of his hold and then he be clutch his bag close to himself and run across campus whilst shout first one back get the first blowjob there be a group of student walk nearby and part of erik be embarrass to think that they might have hear charles outburst but a big part of him be entertain by charles levity and keen to win the challenge\\u2026 and so erik race after charles and it isnt long before he have him erik catch up to charles somewhere near the student lounge and pas him so easily that it almost laughable erik suspect that perhaps charles be hamper by the sheer weight of the book in his bag whilst erik isnt quite a burden or perhaps it the think of charles on his knee with his cherry-red lip around eriks cock that prompt erik to race ahead either way erik reach the dormitory perhaps twenty second before charles do and wait at the entrance arm fold across his chest triumphantly a he wait for charles to catch up when charles arrive his cheek be ting with colour and his hair be in even more disarray than usual but his smile be almost a wide a eriks which suggest that charles isnt too put out about lose nice of you to join me erik call light-heartedly a charles sidle up to him and give erik the finger in consolation erik take charles bag from him and haul it over his shoulder and slide his hand into charles to hold it a they walk upstairs when they enter eriks room the space be warm and humid thank to both the weather that afternoon and the fact that the heat have rise from the floor below but with a flick of eriks finger a nearby electric fan be turn on and erik be step over to the window to open it up he barely finish push open the window though when he feel charles step up behind himself- charles arm snake around eriks waist and charles face press against eriks back hallo erik chuckle lay his hand against charles arm and stroke his palm along the fine hair on charles forearm everything okay mm\\u2026 charles reply rub his face between eriks shoulder blade im just really happy you come to the school with me erik smile i be too those child be remarkable- it amaze that youre help them like that you help too erik i think they really like have you there well i know they do i do too\\u2026 with that charles squeeze erik more tightly rise up on his tiptoe to press his face into the back of eriks neck and whisper i love you the word be say into eriks skin like charles be try to imprint them there like he be try to mark erik with the sentiment- a clear impression of how charles feel etch into eriks skin like a tattoo it more than erik need in term of clarity- he already feel charles devotion in every breath charles takes- but be remind of it on an almost daily basis be a gift nonetheless du bedeutest mir alles\\u2026 erik say softly use the lesson charles have teach him to press his affection into charles mind like a kiss one that charles clearly recognise a immediately he let out a happy murmur- his breath warm against eriks neck a he begin to place kiss to eriks skin youre get really good\\u2026 charles respond his mouth trail along the taut line of eriks shoulder plus i really like feel you inside me like that it kind of kinky\\u2026 be that so\\u2026 erik smirk turn around to face charles and cup charles face in his hand well dont think that get you out of me be inside you in the other way - we do have a deal after all ah i suppose we did\\u2026 charles grin his eye wide and mischievous well im a man of my word if nothing else\\u2026 he add lick his lip and just start to drop to his knee before erik grip charles under the arm to stop him clothe off first\\u2026 erik request firmly try to look authoritative and unaffected rather than like someone completely besotted with lust charles quirk an eyebrow in response but heed eriks word begin to slowly unbutton his shirt a he star into eriks eye of course charles cant just perform the act without be a fuck tease about it and he undo his button slowly torturously flash erik glimpse of creamy white skin adorn with a constellation of freckle a he gradually shrug the garment off when his chest be bar charles next turn his attention to his trouser but doesnt just remove them quickly either he draw his fingertip slowly over his belt buckle first know that erik can feel the warmth of charles hand against the metal and smirk a erik let out a barely-suppressed groan in response something wrong dear charles ask his sweet face the epitome of faux innocence a he draw his belt slowly through the clasp of the buckle before remove it completely erik practically want to growl in frustration and drag charles over to the bed to hurry thing along but erik have learn that- when it come to charles- the wait be always undeniably worth it even if it mean erik suffer from a low burn of arousal that make his cock strain uncomfortably against the confine of his trouser besides within a moment the wait be over and charles be let his clothe fall to the floor to stand before erik with his hand clasp together in front of himself- drop his gaze and appear almost nervous almost shy it remarkable to erik that after so many encounter after all the thing charles have let erik do to him he still have the capacity to be somewhat bashful- a if erik hasnt see every inch of charles skin before now or map it out with his tongue charles isnt even fully nude but the sight be completely captivate nonetheless- particularly a erik can see the prominent line of charles erection just visible behind his clasp hand push up against the loose material of his boxer short charles underwear be new- erik can tell he have see every aspect of charles wardrobe enough to recognise any change and besides- erik would know if he have see this particular garment before\\u2026 erik laugh softly reach down to grasp both of charles hand and gently tug them apart well these be certainly interesting\\u2026 erik grin hook one finger into the front of charles boxer short and run it along the hem draw it over the sensitive skin above charles groin and cause charles to inhale a shaky breath in response the boxer short charles be wear be grey and be adorn with a pattern of tiny red magnet and yellow line presumably suppose to represent a magnetic pull erik have become accustom to the eccentricity of charles wardrobe which appear to be a mix of decidedly formal shirt trouser and cardigan along with a number of t-shirt emblazon with scientific slogan and several pair of gaudy pattern sock but until this point charles underwear have always remain entirely neutral in colour and style erik can only hazard a guess a to why charles have make any change now these be for me erik ask step close and use his grip on the underwear to pull charles towards himself everything i do be for you charles reply with complete conviction star down and watch eriks hand a it touch him do you like them yes\\u2026 erik say with a smile draw his thumb across the point of charles hip where the red starburst of a fade bruise on charles skin mark out the evidence of eriks early affection liebling \\u2026 youre beautiful\\u2026 at that charles look up and the experience be like be hit by a thunderbolt the sunlight glint through the open window be reflect in charles eye in the dazzle array of blue in his irises- like league of colour in the ocean like water that can sustain life or drown people in it wake charles smile at erik seemingly in gratitude almost like he be surprise at the word and erik can understand why\\u2026 although erik may regard charles with such affection and devotion it sometimes make it hard for him to breathe he have never be very good at express himself word of sentiment when seldom speak be often conceal in eriks native language- remind him of the last time he be able to speak so freely when he do so to his mother there be a wall around eriks heart and though charles careful influence have render the barrier a increasingly more like a trellis the gap in eriks defence can only let so much through often erik wonder if it be enough and if his own conservation will drive charles away in the end but when charles look at erik like this- with such love and pure faith in his eyes- erik can allow himself to hope for a time that everything will be okay the moment pas without further comment more say between their eye and from their heart than what can be express in word and then charles be smile somewhat impishly a he trail his hand down eriks forearm use his grip on eriks hand to encourage erik to push the underwear down charles boxer short drop to the floor and erik barely have time to look before charles be kick the underwear away and kneel down on the soft carpet at eriks foot charles keep his eye lock with eriks a he settle down knee part hand rest against the floor cock hard and stand to attention between his leg it a completely bewitch sight and the desire for erik to hastily wrench free of his clothe have never be more tangible but this be no long about what erik can take from charles it about what he can give to him and so erik mimic charles slow seduction from before and remove his clothe leisurely on the floor charles be patient he watch erik devotedly like there be no fine sight in the world than erik gradually peel his t-shirt off and throw it across the room like there be untold secret hide in eriks trouser and he cannot wait to discover them erik be have a moment of regret a he unbutton his jean wish he have take the time to kiss charles before he settle down that he have press his tongue into charles eager mouth to taste charles moan before push him to his knee but it be too late for that now and besides when erik slide his trouser and underwear down in one smooth motion the look on charles face make up for it charles star at the part of erik now expose and his hand immediately tremble like he ache to touch but whatever desire charles be experience be keep in check a he once more look back up to meet eriks eye wait patiently no hand erik say quietly edge his discard clothe away with his foot before step close feel the plush carpet tickle the space between his toe charles eyebrow raise in response but there be a tell-tale smile in the corner of his mouth that say he like this game a he always do and so he simply shift a bite close and wait erik cannot fight the urge to touch so he slide one hand into charles hair to hold him to connect with him and then he move close and angle his cock towards charles wait mouth their eye-contact be unbroken a charles part his lip a erik feel charles breath ghost across the head of his cock a erik begin to push inside feel charles mouth- warm and accommodating- start to surround him erik use his hold on charles hair to guide him watch transfix a charles perfect pink lip slide along the length of his shaft groan quietly a charles clever tongue swirl around the head of his cock erik cant help but buck his hip at that and though it hard to tell completely erik be sure he can see the flicker of a smile in charles bright eye after a short while erik let go of his hold on charles hair and stop rock forward watch instead a charles suck gently on the head of his cock for a while before push forward to take the full length in his mouth again always look up at erik always keep his hand rest against the floor a instruct erik can only tolerate a few moment of that before he have to touch charles again- stroke one hand through the soft lock of charles hair a he lean forward to glance down at the smooth line of charles back at pale skin intersperse with an array of freckle lead down to the round curve of charles buttock a erik admire the view charles push further cause erik to groan a he feel his cock slip into the tight channel at the back of charles throat until charles gasp around the length and have to withdraw and remove his mouth completely when erik lean back to look at charles again his face be flush and he be breathe hard but he still look at erik with such love it make eriks heart ache with feel in response erik brush charles hair back from his forehead and yearn to kiss him but charles be once again edge forward to take eriks cock in his mouth before erik can do anything leave erik lose to the feeling of pleasure once more a his member slide into wet heat still a erik gaze down at charles he smile at him murmur youre amazing\\u2026 and there be a sensation erik can feel come from charles mind like a surge of warmth and erik know he be happy a the encounter continue it be very much like a balance act a reciprocal give-and-take that vary between erik fuck charles mouth and charles suck eriks cock each action cause a hot tight sensation to build up in the base of eriks member cause his stomach muscle to flutter promisingly with each linger thrust the sensation be heighten by the moan come from charles that erik feel vibrate through the length of his shaft moan that be either a a result of charles feel eriks pleasure roll off of him in heady magenta wave or simply because charles be just enjoy himself that much when erik draw close he once more slide a hand into charles hair entwine his finger in thick brown tendril whilst use his other hand to grasp hold of his own cock and start to stroke it doesnt take much- charles mouth be still suck gently at the head of eriks cock and make erik groan in response- and with charles continue to look up at erik so devotedly erik feel the pleasure draw from himself like charles be command it like charles need it a much a erik do a eriks breath stutter in his throat charles finally move his hand rest one palm on eriks knee and squeeze lightly a erik come into charles mouth watch a erik groan in his pleasure and his speech be lose to intermittent german curse there be some time after erik have finish come when charles still keep his mouth on eriks cock draw his lip slowly along the shaft a eriks finger fumble blindly in charles hair in his hazy pleasure-state until erik finally pull back to let his cock slip out of charles mouth and charles once more withdraw his hand for a while erik continue to gaze down at charles stroke his finger slowly through charles hair think about how much he love and need this man who will drop to his knee without question who will give erik everything he want but can never ask for it go much further than the intimacy theyve share than all the time charles have give his body to erik in wilful subjugation a charles have already say everything he do be for erik and though part of erik cannot understand why charles be able to be so devote to someone so unworthy he be grateful for it nonetheless charles remain sit on the floor look up at erik warm sunlight from the window cast a glow upon his face illuminate every delicate freckle on his skin like fade ember in a fireplace he be beautiful and erik reach down for him without question slide his hand under charles arm to pull him up grasp charles thigh once charles be upright and haul the small man up- cause charles to let out a slight noise of surprise in response before he adjust and wrap his leg firmly around eriks waist to hold on erik carry charles over to the bed and lay down upon it find the sheet to be warm against his back courtesy of the rectangle of light that illuminate the bed compliment by the heat from charles body against his front it take a bite of wriggle before erik be able to recline comfortably against the pillow and then he lay there- still and sated- a charles hum happily and nuzzle his face into eriks neck his hair brush against eriks chin a he settle down there be a low buzz of noise come from the world outside- faint voice a pulse of music play bird sing erik register none of it his world be inside this room in his bed in his arm nothing else matter erik trail his fingertip slowly down the curve of charles spine smile a charles let out a tiny moan and snuggle near to erik like close isnt close enough erik can feel charles cock warm and hard in the tight space in-between their body but charles make no move to chase his own bliss it a marker of the selflessness charles exhibit during every encounter he share with erik like he be simply content to be with erik in whatever guise erik choose and he expect nothing in return youre perfect\\u2026 erik murmur press his knuckle into the dimple above charles as against the side of eriks neck charles let out a small chuckle youre only say that because youve just have your cock in my mouth he reply no charles- im say it because youre extraordinary erik counter tilt his face towards charles and slide one hand into his hair charles turn his head at that bath erik in a bewitch bolt of blue a he gaze into eriks eye darling\\u2026 charles say softly one hand trace circle on eriks chest with his fingertip thank you youre perfect too erik cant help but scoff in response and though he immediately see a flicker of discontent manifest in charles expression he cannot bring himself to regret his reaction not even when charles frown and lift his head from eriks shoulder look down at erik disapprovingly i wouldnt say it if i didnt mean it erik youre perfect to me there be wealth of reason erik could offer up for why charles be wrong- all the part erik can feel within himself like stain on his soul- but erik suspect charles already know even if he be too polite to ever mention it out loud it likely charles doesnt regard those aspect a imperfection anyway- he have a habit of see the good in everything in everyone it one of the thing erik love about him most of all youre perfect\\u2026 charles whisper lean close to place heartfelt kiss to eriks jawline cheek forehead- draw soft lip across eriks skin a his hand move to cup eriks face erik can feel charles mind too like soft light in his periphery like the sunlight come in through the open window warm every part of erik that be cold and dark erik be close to admit defeat a he lie there hold charles waist but he still huff quietly under his breath and say you cant say that- you havent just have your cock in my mouth of course charles laugh his breath warm against eriks temple where charles mouth be currently press oh so be that the requirement for utter that statement after all charles smirk well if youd like to rectify the situation im only too happy to accommodate you\\u2026 he add wriggle his hip so that erik feel charles hard member press more firmly against his stomach it a good a way of keep charles quiet a any and so erik murmur alright and slide his hand down to cup charles arse to encourage charles to sit up charles do so slowly but once he be seat straddle eriks waist he look down at erik and say sweetheart i be joke i wasnt erik reply squeeze charles buttock lightly come here\\u2026 erik pull charles gently but firmly towards himself even a charles continue to ask erik if he be sure until charles be kneel just in front of eriks face and he grasp the windowsill behind the bed to steady himself transfer his grip to hold charles waist erik pull charles close but bypass charles strain erection and press his mouth instead to the soft skin of charles groin cause charles to groan heatedly in response charles helpless moan continue for a while a erik trail his tongue over to the crease of charles thigh graze his teeth gently over the point of charles hip until finally he withdraw and bring his mouth close to charles cock at last and brush his lip against the sensitive head before open up and take charles in a erik slide his mouth along charles cock he look up see that charles eye be close but know that his sense be wide open anyway erik can feel the swell of charles pleasure through more than just the thick length in his mouth he can feel it come from charles mind like a warm summer breeze glide through eriks perception continual wave of pleasure crest across eriks mind a erik suck earnestly on charles cock other than the occasional impassioned moan charles be still and serene and the only movement he make be to reach down with one hand to gently push eriks hair back from his forehead he look down at erik and he be glorious- pale and lovely in the sunlight of the afternoon like he be carve from fine marble like he be a work of art when charles come he do so with a low murmur- his release something erik feel run through every part of himself like a pulse of electricity thank to the power of charles telepathy charles leg tremble a he shudder through his orgasm so erik use his hand to hold charles steady and keep his mouth move on charles cock until charles shift uncomfortably due to the increase sensitivity and erik allow him to withdraw charles move like he be go to drop to the side to lay next to erik but instead erik keep hold of charles and pull charles back down on top of himself once more wrap his arm around charles back firmly and tilt his head to place a kiss to charles forehead there be a few blissful moment when charles lift his face and kiss erik slowly passionately like there be nothing he would rather be do with his afternoon with his life and then he settle down once more with his head rest against eriks chest youre perfect\\u2026 charles murmur quietly for once erik doesnt argue with him \",\n          \"kel have a sky the color of charcoal and dirt a few shade dark connie could only tell sky from earth by trace the high black mound in the distance which stand out against the horizon like silhouette of hulk giant against the pitch be gleam white tower hint of other color shin like opal in muck connie look for the three nest tower of what pearl call the temple of heaven and earth and start walk the robonoids follow her her mission be simple retrieve the poofed and damage gem that have be trap in the collapse tower if she could scout the area if she couldnt and determine what have cause every gem in the area to suddenly lose contact with homeworld three hundred year ago connie know that steven would have prefer to come with her and that she would have be smart to wait but she really hadnt want to it be only a little mission and there be no document predator or even multicellular organism on this planet if she be injure or get sick one of the robonoids would send out a distress message there wasnt any real danger plus she think a her communicator activate in her ear with a little ding it wasnt like she be out of range connie how be you do so far be there any sign of hostility nothing yet pearl connie say climb up a few boulder and slide down the other side with a thump her boot throw up little puff of dirt just a whole lot of atmosphere this place be really fascinate it be gem have survey it three century ago and have find a wealth of mineral below the surface they have touch down in their aesthetically-designed ship in all their multitude have build temple and tower and have start terraforming- and then it have stop all at once every preliminary colonist cut off contact without warn and since no one important have be lose the diamond have write them off now since gem be suppose to have individual worth a sapient being the diamond be finally send out a search party three century late maybe that wasnt too long for gems- connie remember no tv for one thousand year thank you very much- but it be still discourage i suppose it be come pearl reluctant response but you can never be too careful remember this be a scout mission if you encounter any dangerous situation you be not to engage understand maam connie walk for another hour dig out a protein bar for quick calorie and duck into shadow alcove at any sign of a glint she find a smash piece of what look like a communicator an intact gem destabilizer and something that could have be a gem shard but turn out to be a rock eventually she pas under hulk abandon injector thick bacteriophage drill into the grind with empty tank but there be no hole around them where new gem have be bear kel for one reason or another hadnt birth any of the new diopsides or jade that it have be annex to provide the injector cast deep shadow over the black soil a the distant twin sun drop under the horizon one lag behind the other like a nervous child connie check her ration figure they be acceptable and call the robonoids close so one of them could provide some light the rest of them continue to range out around her scan the grind for shard the red light didnt damage her night vision which be why it be so useful it do bathe the alien landscape the color of warm blood only illuminate the grind a few foot around her before the light fade into red-tinged shadow connie keep her eye on the grind careful not to step in any hole or trip over an unfortunate rock shed already trip once scrap her elbow and she wasnt interest in do it again only another hour to the temple she would have transport there directly but the close work warp pad have be out in the waste and pearl have think there might be gem who have flee to it before the colony collapse kel have an incredibly dense core for it size which give it about the gravity of mar but it day last about three hour each connie have never have a chance of complete the whole expedition in daylight she wouldnt have have a chance to go on the expedition at all except that there be a breathable atmosphere and something have already happen to the gem in residence the hope have be that an organic could scout out the location without be detect immediately a a gem might connie have mostly jump on the chance because shed be stir-crazy it be spring break back home and she hadnt be to space in age the temple come into view opaline tower gleam dully in the beam of the robonoids and immediately one of them freeze like a point dog laser fix on a shin spot on the grind connie hurry over and pluck the gem up in her hand then jerk back in disgust and drop it sorry she say awkwardly even though the gem probably couldnt hear her she shake the black goop off her palm grimace at the sticky thickness of it and scrap the rest off on a convenient rock into the earth then pull on glove she pick up the gem again and scratch the rest of the gunk off it be a peridot completely undamaged but cover in dust shed never reform that didnt bode well pearl connie ask know the comm would activate at her name i find my first gem shes a peridot and i dont see any damage but her gem be cover in this weird black goo i think it might be keep her from come back she wait for a response but none be forthcoming pearl be you there connie felt goosebump rise on her arm spread out she say and the robonoids fan out around her illuminate the area nothing move but them no change close to them but her communicator wasnt work anymore connie pull off one of her glove and reach up to tug it out of her ear frown when she notice the speck of black on it shimmery case she hadnt touch it before just then so where she touch the black speck and it stick to her finger easily enough but the comm remain dull and here shed think pearl have only be distract for a while stupid how long have she be out of contact more importantly what be this black stuff she stuff the peridot gem in her bag decide not to use any more gem tech if she could help it and come to a decision feel remarkably clear-headed the goop wasnt hurt her and a long a she didnt get it on the warp pad it should still work shouldnt it but every moment these gem spend down here could mean they be deactivate permanently if they werent already and nothing have actually harm her yet plus the more she bring back to the ship the more chance homeworlds scientist would be able to reverse whatever have happen to these gem she just have to do her job and scout like she be suppose to the temple entrance be crumble in on itself the bridge that lead to the rest of it cut off halfway and almost definitely unstable connie spy a high level half-open to the air and shoot her grapple hook to catch in one of the groove she tugged- it held- and buckle herself into her climb harness make her careful way up the crumble mosaic of blue diamond the robonoids follow her closely but keep to her order not to touch the wall she didnt want to risk lose them too the second floor yield more gem stick to the floor or wall alone or in cluster of two or three connie pry them loose carefully keep track- ruby ruby lapis lazuli some kind of quartz- a she place them in her bag one of them she try to pull loose and pull in half instead the black goop the only thing keep it together connie swallow at that distant sorrow hit her like a wave and pack the two halve carefully just in case there werent any other sign of struggle in the hallways- no scuff on the wall no hole in the floor no break weapon or shatter piece only light that wouldnt come on and door that have to be pry open with a crowbar and that black dust collect thick and tarry on every surface connie dig out her own head lamp decide on certainty over retain night vision and light her way forward a brightly a she could it didnt help her unease a much a shed hop it would i dont know if you can hear me pearl because i definitely cant hear you connie say voice barely a whisper in the empty room it still echo like a gunshot deep into the earth but you shouldnt send any gem down here something be seriously wrong farther in she start to find hint of life sign that gem have exist here once a few scrap of someone pet tech project gem script scratch into a wall in what look a lot like graffiti a chamber full of weapon strew about like someone have interrupt a spar match there be an observation orb lie dead on the grind in one chamber and a whole line of button and screen coat black in another some part have script that didnt seem like gem too or bit of technology that werent familiar at all but connie ignore those she have a mission to complete she find a sapphire two other blue gem she couldnt identify and something she think be a kind of rutile her bag grow full but she keep find them so she keep stuff them in wince when they clink against each other there be three hundred gem here at least shed never be mean to actually collect this many she be a scout go into the earth she climb up to the third floor of the temple force open the entrance to the first tower and have squeeze entirely through before she realize that the only light she have be white robonoids no response she peer back through the slim entrance shed manage to create but no red float orb be in sight they must have touch the wall at some point she breach the next inner sanctum gaze wide-eyed at the delicate inlay of the ceiling iridescent white and blue like mermaid scale there be only one gem in this room- a pearl- and connie have to scrabble with her finger for twenty minute to pry it loose in the inside of the tower ceiling so high above it be like look at the sky she could see more clearly how the blackness have spread it only ebb into color at over twenty foot in the air watermarking the wall like flood gauge connie star at it transfix then reach up to her comm- except it wasnt in her ear not on the floor either and not outside in the hallway pearl she ask aloud confuse but the comm didnt spark to life because it have be disable like the robonoids disable and yet shed keep go deep into the temple without even mark her way with only one light and no food and no way out and this hadnt even be her mission - why be she here she should have turn back a soon a her comm stop work she should have report that something be wrong take the first gem shed find back with her and come back with reinforcement let homeworlds scientist look over the sample shed take so far she shouldnt have go deep in alone without give her friend any way to track her or know what she be do something be incredibly wrong something be affect her maybe make her think in way shed be train out of for what purpose what reason - a glint in the corner of the room connie move toward it by rote but it wasnt a gem it be a little doll with a shard of rock sew into it chest with too many arm and a face that wasnt human wasnt really humanoid at all connie hold it blankly unable to make her mind work before something in her scream pay attention and she realize that her hand look wrong her vein be black she swallow back panic and roll up her sleeve to see the black streak cut through her skin all the way up to her elbow which be stain pitch like shed dip it in ink the dark strip continue to her shoulder and radiate onto her collarbone the back of her neck above her breast she press on the dark part but didnt feel pain whatever it be do to her discomfort be not a part of it connie take a deep breath force herself to sit down and cross her leg no more movement until she know what be go on that be final an alien doll a black gunk that kill gem tech a soon a it touch it an infection that make her move deep into the temple and forget what she be suppose to be do what do those have in common what do they mean unfamiliar script and technology mean someone else have be there for long enough that they would have make toy with gem shard and mark up the wall they have be there but they werent there now possibly the same thing have happen to them a have happen to the homeworld terraformers- a be happen to connie she need to get back to the warp pad connie get to her foot stuff the doll in her bag for safekeeping and step back out of the exit her mind blank when she star down both side of the hallway but she grit her teeth and choose a direction scratch a long line across the wall with the remnant of a gem destabilizer the temple wasnt that big she could get out and if she couldnt she could last a few more hour and follow sunlight to an exit whatever be happen it wasnt go to get her urgency force her out of the tower towards the out part of the temple but the hallway all blur together have she go leave or right at that junction have she be at that junction at all more discrepancy jump out at her rot food beneath the black mold sketched-out drawing of creature shed never see before a knife with unfamiliar stylings at the hilt she keep pick them up to put in her bag before realize that they werent gem and didnt need to be take with her it take her long to notice that the reason she couldnt put anything in her bag be because shed drop it somewhere between the inner sanctum and the first tower and when she do notice it send a cold trickle of fear down her back so she couldnt trust her own perception at all then what could she do she take the gem destabilizer- she still have that at least- and scrap out a message on the wall a legible a she could make it dont touch it change your mind do that make sen e do that make any sense at all would it matter if alien saw it since they might not translate maybe all those inscription shed see hadnt be graffiti but similar warning make useless by language barrier connie wish she wasnt too hype on adrenaline and nerve to be fascinate by what could be an alien rosetta stone she finish the message and step back turn to the exit- except she didnt know where the exit be she didnt- but there be an exit but she have a mission no the mission be to- to scout to get out to go deep into the temple and into the earth im not do that connie say to no one but she find herself follow a path anyway step past discard gem and organic scrap connie trail the gem destabilizer across the wall whenever she think of it but mostly she follow the path her foot be make for the path or must have be because it have be follow before she could see print in the black beneath her boot her hand catch at one of the doorway grip white-knuckled and she take advantage of the momentary confusion to wrench herself back and sink to the floor bury her head in her knee stay still she tell herself stay still when you get lose you have to stay still until someone find you you (deeper into the earth) have to wait for rescue somethings in my head maam she say aloud because she think she should im compromise can you find me somehow she be stand again and then she be move her foot hurt but her pace didnt slow the headlamp flicker off finally run out of battery she didnt know if that mean it be daylight it didnt matter she have a path (into the earth) she have a path and she would follow it if her foot would stop stumble if her hand would stop catch at thing if her knee would stop crumble when they didnt even hurt again she be kneel scratch something into the black gunk st st st st over and over again not even a full word stop stay stretch steven she try but it didnt make sense why shed be write his name anywhere he wasnt come with her into the earth he was- in space in orbit at home on the other planet not this planet but a different vast one a strange one with light soil the wall lose their gem-patterns and become dark and musty close to her shoulder so she have to turn sideways to get through the passage there must have be light come from somewhere she could make out shape in the dark and she didnt trip even once the side of the tunnel expand and contract under her finger when she press against them they be warm than her hand into the earth for hour and hour until her stomach felt tight until her foot crack and bleed until her ankle blister against her sock and her leg ache follow the path lay out for her somewhere she drop the gem destabilizer too but she didnt mind it be less weight to carry finally the wall be more red than black bath crimson by a warm beckon light connie step out into an open chamber a cavern so wide that it ceiling be like a stalactite-laden sky and star in wonder horror once connie have see the crystal heart that power the temple back in beach city bright pink and glassy this heart be a deep red so vast it stretch from one horizon of the cavern to another broad than all of beach city combine gleam bitter red glow with blood-warmth and pulse hum through her flesh until she felt loose like wet meat flush all in black and blood others be there too strange being with too many arm and carapace creep along the wall or skitter on the floor connie couldnt move could only stare with blown-wide pupil at the massive beat heart the lovely sanguine center of the planet could only absorb the sight of it her thought ebb and flow jumble into each other until some inner levy break and slosh them loose then she crumble to her knee suddenly light-headed and say wait i dont- this isnt my planet it be though come the think it be her planet her tunnel her beat heart to serve it thrum through her like her own pulse drive her blood to warm her connie shudder hug herself but she couldnt shake the feel that it be right that it had- those gem she try again but the think have already leave her determination make her press on make her gather them back to her like scrap of paper she would say what she mean to say those gem you- hurt them youre the planet you hurt these people some of the alien come close to her catch her by the arm and pull her back into a side of the cavern into an alcove in the wall into the earth they herd her into the dirt and she kick bite at them lizard-brain terror catch where coherence couldnt reach but there be so many of them so many blank and empty-eyed rotten black and slough skin into the dirt to fee the earth they push her in and move close pull strand from their body and wrap her bind her a the heart pulse through her mind and make her limp and unresisting they cocoon her away from the light connies hand be trap against her chest finger brush the heavy strand a they smother her she push against them just a little curious but couldnt press past that into the earth into the planet this wasnt something she should fight the heart beat through her in a lazy percussion expand and contract scarlet on the inside of her eyelid when she blink she close her eye without mean to and breathe slowly in and out like she be meditate until her mind drift away the heartbeat drive her blood to warm her * silence * connie open her eye with a gasp wriggle in her bond and immediately try to scream her body didnt respond to her command though only move like it have a mind of it own and fear suffuse her like cold water shed- be stupid cut herself and not notice get mind-controlled and now it be too late - the cocoon be dark and suffocate red light bleed through the fiber and make her skin glow dark make the streak in her vein stand out the heartbeat pound through her skull disturb now instead of comfort she try to block it out hum in her mind but it bash through her thought like they didnt exist make her brain feel like it be well up with blood all crimson behind her eye all say go to sleep leave it be sink into the earth but she couldnt she wouldnt if she do she would cease to exist she throw every part of her will at her body lash out for control of one eyelid one finger one muscle fiber it be a useless a fight an ocean before when the heart have be lead her shed be able to subvert it now it be like it have take her brain and leave her sever from every nerve end a vestigial organ just wait to be cull like be a puppet but she couldnt be she didnt want to die she have so much to do still- connie try to scream again try to cry try to thrash and escape but her body wasnt hers anymore be just move on it own like an automaton - hold on her voice rasp sound surprise and she freeze that tone of voice- be that- be i connie relief surge through her and she collapse back into the background desperately grateful not the heart not a mindless puppet for an alien planet not a meatsuit for break gem and kill shipwreck alien her body be in safe hand in stevens hand her best friend didnt seem to know what to do with himself at first he use her finger to press against the skin of the cocoon blink slowly then force through the fiber with her shoulder the push make him stumble painfully into the grind and he right himself immediately star at her black-streaked hand they be shake whats go on im be mind-controlled by the planet connie try to say but steven only turn to look around the cramp tunnel obviously confuse he couldnt hear her connie realize with a start he couldnt hear her at all but then how would he know where to go where to pick up the injure gem steven steven im right here you have to listen to me nothing connie despair a he star at her surroundings feel her eye go wide with horror have you be trap here all this time connie im so sorry i- i should have come sooner- he cut off tear prick at her eye but connies mind be blank what how long have it be steven her body continue to move without her permission steven wince at her bloody foot and stagger with one hand to the wall the tunnel theyd herd her into be so tight that it scrap against both her shoulder constrict her chest when she inch sideways and connie be ninety percent sure that it have deepen after theyd cocoon her in she felt steven shudder at the claustrophobic fit crimson light glow at the entrance to the large chamber fill the doorway with red like a giant eye steven falter shrink back but square her shoulder he know a well a connie do that there wasnt another way out he step into the beat heart chamber and freeze up completely pulse go rapid connie wince back from the thrum of influence that pulse through her marshal her thought together a her only defense steven still take in the chamber saw the carapace-aliens and shrink back into the tunnel thats not good he whisper be they kidnap too if youd actually hear me i could help you connie couldnt help think nervous and snappy with it but of course it didnt reach him steven hide in the tunnel until one of the alien step into it and stop at the sight of him then say tentatively hi im steven can you uh- can you understand me the alien regard him blankly head loll and eye rotten black out of it head thorax fall apart like an ant possess by fungi black sludge drip off it and plop onto the floor one of it many arm hang limp and snapped-off at it side too far go for think connie figure and felt steven mirror the conclusion his arm rise up defensively in front of him a the alien approach then falter when no shield appear she could feel the realization steal over him no power no familiarity with the body only whatever connie have leave in her after be hold captive for what have apparently be more than a day steven you have to listen to me you dont know the way out can you hear me he press anyway be you still alive in there he reach out- steven what- and touch the zombie alien side make a face at the sludge coat connies hand the alien pause body stiffening- connie felt a burst of incredulity- then fly into motion grab connies wrist and slam her against the wall steven yelp in her voice and kick out at it wriggle loose and duck beneath it claw but her body be weak other alien wrestle it onto it knee they hold her arm behind her back and force them- force steven - to look into the beat heart it be blood and warmth and vitality so intense it hurt to witness be glow bright than a star wash the world crimson like a moonset feed it life into the dirt and the rock and it trillion of spore it artery reach into the core of the planet it capillary fine and fast beneath it crust it lung melt in the mantle of the world in the high chamber it be the world so large it remind connie of stevens description of the cluster and it vein reach over connies head like massive tree trunk sink deep into the earth deep into the earth she was- this be her planet she belong to it- she felt her fist clench you cant have her steven growl with her voice she doesnt belong to you none of these people do something thrum pulse throb through her flesh and pull it apart like cook muscle loose and stringy connie felt nauseous and transfix overwhelm but steven only say heatedly she doesnt belong to anyone the hive-aliens creep close stain with black goop and drip it i need you to let her go okay i know it must have hurt when homeworld start drill into you but connie didnt have anything to do with that shes just here on a rescue mission it doesnt care connie try to say but the word wouldnt come steven what be you do the heart reach into her head and twist drag a scream out of her that never leave her lip connie lash out at it try to make her thought a sword but it bat her aside like she be nothing smother her thought until she couldnt breathe what be you- stop that steven sound panic could he feel it could he feel her could he hear her the heart pulse bright in retaliation for his command sear out every think in connies head even a she spat and curse at it throw all she have into resist but it wasnt enough and the agony be blind steven steven please- i say stop it steven scream in connies voice and the red light snap back and dim like it have be strike connie felt strange like there be something overlap with her body something new course through her like fresh energy- and then the sensation disappear foot move rapidly beneath her and she realize that steven be run run the wrong way connie try to lurch her foot in the right direction jerk a hand anything but her body wasnt her own steven have take it over completely she settle for yell at him try to get him to hear something but she be too late her body run up to a dead end pant and shake and she felt her face fall steven whirl around but the alien be already block the exit cluster against the light we can still fight she yell but he be already shrink back hesitance make him slow he could heal anything if he could just get her body to the surface he could resurrect her anything would be good than be an eternal mind-slave to a sociopathic planet seriously steven one of the alien jerk close on rickety leg and steven dive under it roll onto his foot and dash down another hallway he bounce off the breathe wall in his haste shudder at their warmth and take passage wildly dart back and forth like he be under a spell connie didnt understand until steven mutter come on garnet double back and narrowly dodge more of the hive-aliens and then she realize it be future vision she hadnt know he could carry that over into another body her foot be bleed bad now but there be no time to stop steven sprint into gem-made tunnel at last take turn like hed live in the temple all his life and trip over her bag slam hard into the grind he scramble upright immediately tense like he be about to keep run but stop and star at the bag for a second before grab it and sling it over her shoulder connie sigh in internal relief finally her body wouldnt move any farther muscle shaky and unable to hold her weight and steven wedge her into a small alcove at the temple edge and hide ear strain for any sign of pursuit it take a while for connie to push past her exhaustion to notice he be speak no- he be cry tear stream down her cheek and leave trail in black dust please dont be too late he be whisper hug her knee im sorry i didnt notice im sorry please dont be too late youll be okay i know you will- and connie hadnt think about how it must seem that hed take over her body when he must have only want to contact her but now it be all too obvious im fine im right here be almost out she try to push at him but he didnt hear her he just keep weep quiet and terrify completely unaware of her presence im gonna get you out of here he promise we have a plan okay we just need to get to the cliff and we can get out take all these gem with u you just have to be alive in there okay dont be a zombie it hard to be jam bud with a zombie believe me steven im try my best eventually she hear scuffle below them steven hear it too scramble to her foot just a a horde of alien erupt from the dirt and then they be run even a connie felt like she be about to collapse the alien be fast wherever theyd be from they move like spider or scorpion skitter in quick tiny step and connies exhaust body wasnt quick enough to outrun them in her mind the heart pulse come back come back come back but she didnt have to listen didnt even have to resist listen her body wasnt in either of their control the alien chase them to the west of the temple away from the warp pad and to the jag hill connie be only start to remember the map shed review when steven crest a hill and she realize they be head straight toward a cliff be this what you be talk about steven her friend freeze stagger like he saw something else then- stumble faltered- connie leap to her foot adrenaline course through her vein and whirl to see a horde of alien encroach her brain felt empty and strange echoey and she couldnt find any trace of steven anywhere steven she shout through her rasp throat steven be you there what be i suppose to do from here do you see something else future vision could have tell him this would kill her or that his body be under attack or any number of thing what have make him leave so suddenly what have he see what be he plan to do be the cliff still part of the plan it didnt matter either way connie be corner and shed never be clue in in the first place she back up a the horde approach snarl and lash out at reach appendage and think come on garnet think he be head toward the cliff he be run full tilt and stop suddenly if im catch im dead anyway and steven wont let me die- the cliff the cliff be the plan and steven hadnt be plan to stop and anyway she be out of option if she die they could retrieve her body and resurrect her if she break every bone in her body steven could heal her the only unacceptable option be be enslave by the beat heart and she already know steven could pull her out if that happen it be like one of the trust fall that their gym teacher make them do in school close your eye spread your arm lean back let gravity take you if you be lucky- if the other person be strong enough be pay attention- they would catch you be steven strong enough be he pay attention connie already know the answer to both be yes you should have ask nicely she rasp at the encroach horde dare to smirk and step backwards into open air \"\n
